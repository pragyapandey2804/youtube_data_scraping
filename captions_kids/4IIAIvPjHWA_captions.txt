I lost how about this is it going to pop
not going to pop it's going to pop oh it
lost again how about this one is it
going to pop a lot of nails it's
definitely going to pop maybe it won't
pop this time hm we'll
[Music]
see why is didn't it pop yay hey I'm on
again it's magic Uncle it's not magic
it's science Eva since you get it right
you can play in the balloon house
yay
wow
[Music]
yay it's not even
fun now let's move on to another
experiment with balloons and
pepper first I rub the balloon on my
hair
I hold it close to the
pepper
wo wao what's happening Uncle when you
rub your hair with a balloon you're
moving tiny little things called
electrons from your hair onto the
balloon your hair loses electrons making
it positively charged and the balloon
becomes negatively charged that's called
static electricity let me
try
awesome I have a lot
my turn my
turn this is like magic great job Eva
now let's move on to another balloon
experiment now for our next experiment
we're going to guess if the skewer will
pop the balloon oh
no remember always do experiments with
adult supervision let's
[Music]
see
wo mhm mhm how is it
possible let me
explain imagine your balloon is like a
big stretchy spaghetti when you blow air
into the balloon you're asking the
spaghetti to stretch out to make room
for the air now think about the top and
bottom part of the balloon where you
tied it and where it looks darker over
there the spaghetti pieces aren't
stretching as much they're more relaxed
because they're not holding as much air
so if you gently push something Sharp
like a skewer you're asking some of the
spaghetti pieces to move aside without
letting go of each other's hands they
can do this because they're not
stretching too much and have room to
move that's why the skewer can go
through without popping the balloon wow
that's am amazing how did the balloon
not pop in the first experiment Uncle if
you push the balloon into one pointy
thing like a nail it's like putting all
the pressure into one tiny little spot
and pop the balloon can't handle it and
it bursts go ahead what happens if we
have more Nails Uncle when there are
more Nails the pressure gets spread
between all the nails it makes it harder
to pop the
balloon so what happens if we have a lot
of nails Uncle so when we have a lot of
nails the pressure will spread out
between every single nail and here also
so it makes it harder to pop the balloon
oh now I
[Music]
know see probably that made me tired the
same thing happens when you step on a
lot of eggs awesome they won't break E I
want try me too all right go
ahead it's not breaking the egg won't
break because Ellie's weight is spread
between a bunch of the eggs turn my turn
y we learned a lot today now you two can
go play at the balloon house yay
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
there's so much over
here Eric it's

awesome
W slime travel Dax made it to help us
travel anywhere let me
try
wo AE let's go
okay let's go oh

fish in the ocean too oh no Eric's not
here how can I open the museum
oh we arrived let's go okay we here okay
let's set up
[Music]
now done everyone welcome to Eric's
slime exhibit wao this is some cool
stuff hope everyone enjoys the show if
you have any questions please ask Eric
yep have a question what's this and
what's that do I do
this oh no it's eating it don't worry
Uncle Sam it's just magnetic slime mag
slime yes watch
this
oo amazing ooh this is amazing thank you
I really enjoy this happy face slime
Eric oo potion slime o look at this
shark that's interesting wo there's a
treasure box in there wow look at that
fish now this one is Artsy I like it me
too my slime project turned out really
successful thank you for helping me
[Music]
huh the slime's eating the
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
magnet awesome and it's not over
yet
wow check it out check it out let's go
check it out check it out my cool
experiments what's the experiment Uncle
check this out
[Music]
why is the coin not dropped because the
coins are magnetic that's correct but
check it out
y
wo
YooHoo I love
it yeah this is my best experiment oh oh
look like I got a close
sorry sorry I guess we'll have to go
home
[Music]
now I really wanted the magnetic slime I
want the corn expent I think I could do
an experiment for
you oh I love
slime now we put some
[Music]
sprinkles and now we have some blue
Y
yooo and now we add the magnet only do
experiments with adult supervision is
the Slime magnetic yet uncle not yet
watch huh we add iron filing to make it
[Music]
magnetic
y a little more iron filing
[Music]
the iron filing will make the Slime
[Music]
magnetic wow that's
[Music]
interesting
H
awesome wo that's interesting Uncle do
magnets attract to everything like wood
just try it Alex
[Music]
nothing's happening magnets don't
attract to glass plastic or wood uncle
can you do the coin fillment sure H this
should be
easy connect the coins right
[Music]
here uhoh don't worry I got it this
[Music]
time yay it looks w
but how does it work
Uncle H actually I don't
know I know I'm Uncle Jason remember
from the science fair magnetic
experiment Master yeah I remember you
can you explain this experiment Uncle
sure the closer you are to a magnet the
stronger the pull is that's why this
coin is so tough however the further
away you get the weaker the pull is
that's why this coin over here can spin
y can I do more experiments for us
please sure no problem and now let's see
what
happens why is it floating Uncle so we
have two magnets of the same pole
they'll repel each
other awesome that's why you can see
that the magnets are
floating can the car move uncle
wo once again the same poles push each
other that way the car can move let's
see what happens when we change the
poles opposite poles will attract each
other this is really fun Uncle so
remember fun fact two magnets of the
same pole will repel each other while
two magnets of opposite poles will
attract H that's pretty cool but is
there anything more exciting here then
I'll show you a
[Music]
trick wow W the magnet can work through
your hand that's another fun fact
magnets can work through our bodies as
well as through
water I want to go fishing Uncle okay go
right
ahead
y one
[Music]
experiments are so cool can we do some
more sure check this
out wow this is like a UFO trying to
land somewhere on Earth yes The Swinging
magnet is attracted to each magnet as it
swings but at first it swings too fast
for any magnet to capture it after a
while it swing slows down and finally a
magnet trap in yay now this one is
pretty cool watch
yooo huh how this spitting and floating
at the same time because all of these
magnets are facing the same direction
they're repelling each other but because
these two magnets are reping this one in
the middle towards each other it's
causing it to float the same thing
happens on the back side too these two
magnets are pushing the back end upwards
which causes both sides to float this is
like magic
Uncle next up I'm going to build a
sculpture out of just a magnet and these
huh all right let's get started the nuts
become magnetic when they're placed on a
magnet in other words magnets can make
other objects magnetic we learned a lot
today uh-uh it's not
over a globe how does a magnet relate to
a globe it's very related the Earth is
one big magnet Earth is like a huge
magnet too but way stronger the Earth
has something called a magnetic field
that goes all around it this magnetic
field is invisible but it's like a big
force field surrounding the earth just
like how magnets have a North and South
Pole the Earth has its own magnetic
poles we call one of them the North Pole
and the other one the South Pole they're
not the same as the geographic North and
South Poles when it's cold but they're
close the Earth's giant magnet is
created by something called the Earth's
core it's like the Earth's engine deep
inside the core is made of hot melted
metal and it's always moving and
swirling around this movement of the
core creates the Earth's magnetic field
the magnetic field is really helpful for
us because it protects us from the sun's
harmful Rays it's like a big Shield that
keeps us safe so just remember the Earth
is like a giant magnet with a magnetic
field that protects us and helps us find
our way isn't that a
amazing mhm that's an amazing fun fact
Uncle mhm magnetism is real interesting
thanks Uncle we learned a lot about
magnet today bye
