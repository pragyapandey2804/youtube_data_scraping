With a messy hairstyle 
Looking stylish on the runway yuh
The earphone volume is always up 
Ripped jeans and a dangling key chain
Unsolicited opinions are not welcome, no
My lunch menu matters more than anything 
I just wanna talk about fantasy
Yeah let’s escape from reality
When someone asks What is your favorite hobby
I would answer that it’s laughing continuously
No matter what they say
Now that I’m crazy I like to live as I wish 
Oh my god
Life is so good
The world is on my side
Life is so good
Love is on my side
Life is so
Dynamic and chilling
Life is so
Dynamic and vibing
Life is so good
Yeah I don’t wanna know about fallin’ down
It’s so dynamic that my life is thrilling 
Sometimes I run out of breath, but enduring it all is what’s cool
Nod nod
Hey, you look a little down, would you like to be happy with me
I’m up for a trip, blowing on a cup of hot cocoa
Let’s laugh and chat 
As if we never shed tears yesterday 
Let go of everything that’s suffocating us
Paradise is right in front of us yeah yeah
Oh I don’t want to lie, lie, lie down here
I hate the hangover, so I don’t mix with the misfortunes
Thanks to that, I stand tall, and other concerns
Yeah I don’t know I don’t know
I laugh again 
Oh my god
Life is so good
The world is on my side
Life is so good
Love is on my side
Life is so
Dynamic and chilling
Life is so
Dynamic and vibing
Life is so good
Life is so
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like, I feel like
Yeah Life is so
Hey
Life is so
Dynamic and chilling
Life is so
Dynamic and vibing
Life is so good
