Up on the housetop, reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little Christmas joys
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn’t go?
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn’t go?
Up on the housetop
Click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
First come the stockings in a row
Filled with goodies top to toe
Then to the tree old Santa springs
To place the presents that he brings
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn’t go?
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn’t go?
Up on the housetop
Click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
Everything delivered from his sack
Santa has a cookie snack
Back to the reindeer and the sleigh
Into the night they fly away
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn’t go?
Ho ho ho
Who wouldn’t go?
Up on the housetop
Click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
