Countless trials, mistakes and fights
Piled up on a teary night
That all ends today, so I smile
Like the days are on fire
I run to this end of story it’s not gonna be a sad ending
I know that on the final page, there will be an incredible plot twist
What if these expectations just explode and fall apart
I hope this terrifying anxiety is just a dream that’ll disappear when I wake up
Every time I see you cry, I felt like drowning in the dark
You said it’s fine but no I’m not
’Cause all I want is you, not your tears
Until the tears dry up 
I wanna make you the happiest one, no fear
So baby, hold my hand now
Baby hold my hand now
Baby hold my hand now
Thoughts are deeply rooted and forgotten memories come back to me like a cough
I’m suffocated by these emotions that take over me like multiplying bacteria
What do you want from me, even the gods can’t deny my hard working past
Even if I leave for a moment, I come back as expected
Every time I see you cry, I felt like drowning in the dark
You said it’s fine but no I’m not
’Cause all I want is you, not your tears
Until the tears dry up 
I wanna make you the happiest one, no fear
So baby, hold my hand now
Baby hold my hand now
Baby hold my hand now
(Baby hold my hand now)
(Baby hold my hand)
’Cause all I want is you, not your tears
Until the tears dry up 
I wanna make you the happiest one, no fear
So baby, hold my hand now
’Cause all I want is you, not your tears (tears tears tears)
I wanna make you the happiest one, no fear
So baby, hold my hand now
Baby hold my hand now
Baby hold my hand now
