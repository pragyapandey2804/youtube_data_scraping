how strong is Saturn's gravity it is not
that strong in fact even though Saturn
is much larger than Earth its gravity is
only a little more as compared to Earth
this is because as compared to Earth
which is solid Saturn is only made up of
gases this makes Saturn very light for
its size actually Saturn has the lowest
density of all the planets in our solar
system even lower than the density of
water hm
