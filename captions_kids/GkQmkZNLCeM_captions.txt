driving on water looks so fun
good thing there's no fish in the tank
they might be scared
here they come for the final lap wait
they're going two different directions
there that's better
wow that was great i think both racers
had fun
but we still have another surprise in
the yellow crayon let's see what it is
wow what could this be
it's a yellow banana
we can peel the banana to see what's
inside
i see four different pieces inside the
banana
the first piece says kitty it must be
the pet do you have a cat or dog at home
if so what's their name ooh look at this
special shiny gold piece it says
mommy
mommies are special

is daddy and this daddy's a cute banana
man try saying that three times fast and
the last member of our family is a baby

there's definitely something in here i
can feel it
there i got it oh it's a beanie boo skye
from the paw patrol skye is a high
flying pup that likes to help out on air
rescue missions
now let's see if there's anything else
left in the pink crayon
oh it looks like an egg
it is it's a hatchimal egg with a purple
heart on it let's see what cool animal
we get inside
i see something green but i'm not sure
what it is yet
there we go come on out little guy
i think it's a green frog with pink
wings that means it's uncommon and hard
to find so i guess we're pretty lucky
now that we opened up our small crayons
it's time to open the big blue one
hi blue crayon hi i can't wait to show
you what's inside me
and we can't wait to see either
[Music]
i bet this one has more stuff inside
since it's so big
look at that our first surprise is the
woodsy babies blind box it could be so
many different animals a box a cow a
squirrel let's see which one we get
oh here's the little baggie with the
baby inside
i can't wait to see what kind of animal
do you think it's gonna be
[Music]

it's a kitty were you right
just look at this cute little kitten her
name is lola in the blind box doubles as
a little bed for her isn't that pretty
cool

some milk
they're all full
now she can have a little now and our
next surprise in the blue crayon is this
little blue car
and watch what happens when we press the
wheels it lights up and plays sounds
that's really neat
and the door is really open and closed
too wow that's pretty awesome
now let's send our blue car off for a
little ride
[Music]
whoa look at it go
now let's see if there's anything else
left in our crayons hey there is it's a
little cube with superman on it that's
pretty neat but i think there's
something inside so let's open it up and
see whoa what in the world
it looks like pieces of a doll
any idea who it could be let's put it
together and find out whoever she is she
has a pretty blue dress
her hair has a snowflake on it i wonder
if that's a clue
here's her face but she looks kinda
weird without the rest of her hair
ah here it is let's slide it on
i think i know who it is do you
i'll put her arms on while you have time
to think
it's elsa from frozen with olaf the
snowman i bet you knew that didn't you
she has a crystal blue dress with a
lovely blue cape just like in the movies
what a cool little poseable figure
now that we got all our cool toy
surprises it would be a shame to let all
the gumballs go to waste so let's invite
rocky with this brand new recycle truck
to help us
let's start by adding some purple
gumballs
and now some of rocky's favorite color
green
some red ones as well
yellow ones too
some pink ones
and finally blue
now let's start recycling and see what
we get
whoa amazing
we got two colorful glass cubes that you
can see through they have blue
yellow
and red
i wonder if we can use them to mix
colors let's see what blue and red make
purple wow
now blue and yellow
they make green
and finally yellow and red
wow they made orange
what a cool way to learn about colors
i'm glad we got these from recycling

of fun see you next time
