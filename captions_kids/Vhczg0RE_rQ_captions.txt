rush to the bathroom to beat the Crowd
Oh same here there's some pushy blue
hairs at the senior center then before
school I'll sometimes stop for a flippy
watermelon lime is my favorite it's my
favorite flavor of gelatin okay gang
here's the plan at midnight we sneak out
of the house and switch places with the
doubles they'll take it from
there I got
this good luck to you guys are you sure
you're ready don't worry about us we're
going to be a
okay family gather around we can follow
the action via the cameras I installed
in everyone's room last
year last
night oh we have movement in the twins
room here it
comes huh I thought for sure Lan was
going to nail them with a bucket of
Grease or a sock full of quarters old
Lincoln is on the move move
slowly oh man I can't watch what's
happening did he get
injured well he did hurt his back but it
seems unrelated what's the dealo why
aren't they getting pranked why are they
leaving the
house what the heck I paid good money
for them to get their butts pranked off
wait a minute I get it Lan's prank this
year was not to prank us at all what do
you mean mom she knew we'd go crazy
trying to protect ourselves so she just
let us chase our Tails oh you're right
she is
good well I may have burned through all
our savings but at least it's over over
it's just getting
started you know family I had a whole
different plan in mind for today but
I'll save that for next year because
once I saw the amazing doubles you guys
found I was inspired to do something
even better so stay tuned because the
rest of this day is going to be doubly
special get it you don't now but you
will what is she talking
