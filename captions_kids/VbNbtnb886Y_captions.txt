the wheels on the bus go round and round
round and round round and round the
wheels on the bus go round and round
racing through the
town the bus is walking on two long legs
two long legs two long legs the bus is
walking on two long legs
all through the
town the buses have a wings that can
make them fly make them fly oh so high
the buses have a wings that can make
them fly
over the town
