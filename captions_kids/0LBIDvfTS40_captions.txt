We put the pieces all together,
make sure it all looks right.
Now we're swinging with our hammers,
Gotta get the nails in tight.

We like to build, but we love, love, LOVE to dance!
We paint the pieces with our paintbrush.
Make sure the color's right.
Now we're twisting with screwdriver,
Gotta get the screws in tight.
It's fun to dance like a robot,
Moving your gears around.
It's fun to play with a basketball.
