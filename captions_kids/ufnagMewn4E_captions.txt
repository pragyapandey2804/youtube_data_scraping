Hey! You wanna come on a creepy adventure with me?
Bearhead was trick-or-treating 
and got lost in this dark forest.
We’ve gotta go in there and rescue him.
Come on! Let’s run fast like wolves!
Run, running through the woods.
Run, running like the wolves.
Oh swipe that branch!
Run, running through the woods.
Look out!
Run, running like the wolves.
Another one!
Run, running through the woods.
Run, running like the wolves.
Run, running through the woods.
Whoah!
What are all these cobwebs doing here?
Spooky spiders everywhere!
Oh! Look out!
Get off the ground!
Phew. Thank goodness they’re gone.
Oh, but how are we gonna get 
past this thorn patch? Hmm…
Look! A bat costume. Let’s 
use it to fly over the thorns!
All right. Come on!
Fly, flying through the night.
Flying like a bat in flight.
Look out for the bats!
Fly, flying through the night.
Flying like a bat in flight.
To the side!
Fly, flying through the night.
Flying like a bat in flight.
Fly, flying through the night.
We’re almost over the thorns!
Ha ha! We made it! Oh no! More cobwebs!
You know what that means!
Spooky Spiders everywhere!
Ah! They’re back!
Oh no! We gotta get off the ground!
Phew that was close.
I see a trail through the corn 
field. Ooooh. It looks like there  
are some scarecrows blocking our path though.
We’re gonna have to knock 
them out of the way. Come on!
Run, fast as you can.
I see a scarecrow coming up.
Knock away all the straw-men
Grab a pumpkin and roll it at him!
Run, fast as you can.
Haha, nice!
Knock away all the straw-men
There’s another. Knock it down!
Run, fast as you can
Knock away all the straw-men
Run, fast as you can
There’s Bearhead!
“Hey! What’re ya doin’ in my cornfield?!”
Oh no! It’s a giant candy corn!
Ah! Look out for the candy!
To the side!
Jump the licorice!
Duck!
That made him dizzy!
I think he’s getting frustrated.
Yeah!
You hear that?
Spooky Spiders everywhere!
Oh no!
How are we gonna get outta here!
The wings!
Let’s reach out and grab ‘em!
Alright! Let’s fly!
Grab a hold, Bearhead.
Come on, buddy. Let’s go home.
