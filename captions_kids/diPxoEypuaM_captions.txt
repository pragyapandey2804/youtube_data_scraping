[Music]
Sheriff Labrador what's going on I
suppose that long thin and crackling
monster that the kids mentioned is a
power line a power line mhm when a power
line touches the ground it electrifies
the ground nearby and if you come close
your feet will feel numb in that case
you need to put your legs together and
hop away just like a bunny or else your
life might be in danger and if you see
someone get shocked don't touch them or
you'll get shocked
too that was close we need to find the
power line now to prevent further
accidents H little wanton show time

kids when you see a fallen power line on
the ground make sure to stay away from
it if you happen to enter an electrified
area and your feet feel numb don't go
any further lift one foot or put your
legs together and hop away from there
just like a
bunny if you see someone gets shocked
you should never go near them you should
ask adults for help

get buried under the debris as well so
never go inside them not even out of
curiosity
