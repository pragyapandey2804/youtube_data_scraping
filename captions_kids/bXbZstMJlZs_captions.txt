underneath both feet underneath us and
then there we go
perfect all right great okay now what
now we're going to head over to the Blue
Lagoon the Blue Lagoon Blue Lagoon so we
got to march to get there okay so arms

blippy yeah well thank you so much for
teaching me how to ice skate you're very
welcome well I should probably get going
to look for a clue hey have you seen a
clue anywhere around here what kind of
clue oh well it's actually just a clue
on a snowflake oh I think I saw
snowflake on the Zamboni oh the Zamboni
I love zambonis let's go look for The
Clue at the Zamboni let's go
wa check it out a
Zamboni yeah he said the clue might be
at a Zamboni and zamb bonies are used to
go on the ice rink and resurface the ice
and make it nice and
smooth before we do that I think we
should have some fun let's go come
[Music]
on all right here we go
this is
[Music]
awesome W that was awesome all right now
I think it's my turn to
drive okay first I need to put on these
covers wo wo yeah these covers
go on the blades so then I don't slip
while I'm on the metal steps there we go
perfect and I'll step right
[Music]
up all right here I
go
W I love driving the Zamboni what a cool
machine wa
[Music]
H wow that was so much fun driving the
Zamboni and also I had so much fun
riding behind the Zamboni that was
awesome but we didn't find the clue yet
H and he said it was around here what if
we explore the outside of the Zamboni
see all the parts of it and maybe we'll
find the clue let's do
[Music]
this
wa this zanoni is awesome okay what two
colors do you see right here yeah green
and black this Zamboni is green and
black oo hey this right here is duct
tape seems like someone in the past had
an accident so silly wo check these out
these tires are so cool see those little
pieces of metal those are called studs
yeah they grip into the ice so then it
doesn't slip and slide wo oh and look at
this this is the tank of the Zamboni it
is so big that's where all the shavings
go into and then you dump it out oo and
look at this this is is the board brush
yeah wo these are some tough bristles
this helps get everything off the edge
of the ice rink yeah the
boards wow cool okay let's go to the
back wo look up here wo this is where
the operator sits so many cool levers
and gauges and gadgets and a really nice
seat wow check this
out this is what's called The
Conditioner this is where there's a
blade and then there's water that spits
up and then makes the ice nice and flat
yeah and look in
[Music]
here wa check that out that is the augur
kind of looks like a cork
screw it helps turn up the top layer of
the
ice who and then all that extra ice goes
up and then into the tanks yeah but
check these out these are also tanks but
this tank is a propane tank that's how
this Zamboni gets its power yeah some
cars have gas some cars have Diesel and
some have propane it's not very common
though wait a second do you see what I
see

you what do we do what do we start with
so the first thing that we're going to
do we're going to take our dough which
just came out of the refrigerator okay
it's a little hard so we need to knead
it so it's soft enough so that we can
press our cookie cutters into it oo I'm
really excited so I'll take a little
piece and then I'll give you some as
well wow
W waa it's so
soft okay so what do we do we're going

push this down we're going to just knead
it just a little bit with our with the
bottom of our hands okay here we go push
it down push it
down y push a little bit more get a
little flatter there we go and the next
thing we're going to do is take our
rolling pen put a little bit of flow on
there wow and we're going to roll this
flat so we're going to roll it this way
okay my turn here we
[Music]
go
whoa
wow uh-oh what do I do right there
nothing at all it's just fine we just
won't cut a cutter there so we're all
good Perfect all right so now I'll put
this right here and now so we have
different cutters here I think I'll pick
the Snowman wao a Snowman
and I will start with the
snowflake so what we're going to do is
put our cookie cutter on top of the
dough okay okay and I'll do mine right
there and we're going to gently press
down until it hits the board okay
perfect push
down W and then we're going to give it a
little bit of a wiggle okay wiggle
wiggle wiggle and then we're going to
lift the cookie cutter off okay lift it
up we
who wow perfect great oh it's so great
all right do we do the rest yes I'll
grab the star okay I'll do a
[Music]
square I'll do the circle okay and then
I will do the gingerbread man
[Music]
wow and our last one is the letter B
we're going to have blippy do the letter
B so with this cookie cutter you see
it's a little different there's two
pieces the reason there's two pieces the
small piece is going to go in the center
so that we cut out a hole for the letter
B okay so you put your letter B down
first
okay push it down perfect and then
you'll oh look at that use a little
insert and put there you
go perfect jiggle get that one out there
we go okay and poke that
out that's silly okay and we'll do the
other one right
there okay and then poke that out yes
all right give our bee a little jiggle
jiggle there we go there we go perfect
all right now all of our cookies are all
cut so we're going to do now is take
them off of here okay and we're going to
place them on our parchment page paper
[Music]
perfect perfect all right now can we
decorate them not quite we need to let
them cook for about 12
minutes oh I'm so excited feels like
it's taking forever
I have an idea why don't I clean up in
the meantime and then we can look at all
of our decorations yeah all right now
that we're nice and clean and organized
we can check out all of the sprinkles
and the icing first we have some orange
sprinkles we have some
red wo my two favorite colors blue and
orange we have some light blue we have
some
green we have some yellow and we have
some
white I'll clean that up later all right
let's put those right over there that's
what we're going to sprinkle on top of
the cookies all right and then check
these out we have some icing we have
green icing I love icing it's so yummy
we have some
yellow we have some
red
blue and white okay hey I have an idea
why don't we decorate a couple of the
cookies with my two favorite colors do
you know my two favorite
colors yeah blue and
orange
W so silly okay first to make orange we
need yellow and red and we need to mix
them together so let's just pipe a bunch
of red and yellow in
[Music]
there okay put that down and now we need
a bunch of
yellow it's really tough to squeeze all
right there we go all right so let's
actually mix it up and see how light or
dark a of an orange we have so let's
just mix mix
mix hey there we go let's turning out
pretty good and it looks really
yummy hey there we
go wow there we go we did such a good
job making the color orange wow
I just want to eat it but I can't I'm
going to wait to put it on the cookies
okay so now we have orange now we need
blue yeah we have blue right here but I
think we should make it a little bit
lighter in color yeah maybe like a light
blue so let's put that right over here
and then let's add some
blue perfect there we go so now we need
to mix it up
[Music]
again wow look at that blue wo it looks
so perfect all right so now what I need
to do is put these colors in these
piping bags W yeah but before I do that
I'm going to clean off my
fingers all right
need to take this
rag
perfect here we
go this is going to be a little tricky
but I think I got
[Music]
this that looks pretty
good okay well I'll keep it like this oh
there we go that's how I do it push it
down to the bottom now it's ready to
squirt out some
orange all right so now for the light
blue
so here's a bag I'm getting all messy
that's okay all right here we go to
clean it up this is so much fun
yeah all right so now we need a couple
big
Scoops put it in the
bag
perfect then the second big
scoop
wow
perfect put it right in the
bag yeah
and then I'll squeeze it down to the
bottom now it looks like we're ready to
make some blue and orange cookies I am
