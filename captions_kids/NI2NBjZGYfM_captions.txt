"Now Y"
"Here is B"
“Bingo!”
Filled up in my brain 
Are imaginations or something like a dream 
Time to get this party
Started now
I don’t wait, after taking a step
With all my might in this world
Na na na na na
Right now
Na na na na na
Ooh
No one, no one will care
Ooh
Even if you free yourself even morewithout hesitation 
Nothing can stop you at this moment
I feel your free spirit alright 
It’s time to bet bet bet
Bet on what you want
As if there’s no tomorrow 
Explode the dynamite in me 
(Show me what you wanna do)
One more time
Countdown 3 2 1
Enjoy the moment every day 
This freest moment 
Say yeah
This is our Youth
Left or right wherever it is go  
Following our instincts, we flow 
Don’t worry about what others think
Dive into it we can do anything you & I woah 
Don’t stop me woah 
Feeling like I’m Superman
I’m like woah
All night
Na na na na na
All day
Na na na na na
Ooh
No one, no one will care
Ooh
Even if you free yourself even more without hesitation 
Nothing can stop you at this moment
I feel your free spirit alright 
It’s time to bet bet bet
Bet on what you want
As if there’s no tomorrow 
Explode the dynamite in me 
(Show me what you wanna do)

It’s okay to be awkward sometimes
