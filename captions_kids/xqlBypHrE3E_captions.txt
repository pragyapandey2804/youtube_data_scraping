hey guys today we're doing a water
Stadium obstacle CL whoa we got a ton of
playsets and we're going to use water
pretty much in all of them and then we
got six tables wo this is going to be
fun
[Music]
yeah you turn it the wrong way turn the
other way oh that's so warm what truck
should we use uh water we should we
could maybe use a water changer trucks
water changer trucks um color change
Color Changers do color Chang all right
so while we get our trucks you go get
yours K to
K look at how polite Caleb is kids he
takes his shoes off when he comes in the
house I thought you were going to close
the door oh look at how polite Caleb is
kids he remembers to close the door when
he comes in the house let me just eat a
chip thank you Caleb it's been a rainy
day last couple days so that's what we
thought we should do a water stadium is
this where our color TR Chang of trucks
are yeah we got a ton of them these all
of our these are all of our color ch
trucks
cool wa wa there's some new ones in here
yeah which ones this one a scorpion one
I'm going to flip them all over and see
which ones are new okay this one for
sure Duck and Roll I don't know the
names of all these trucks you know what
we should do we should run them them all
under hot water it might take like a
minute but I just want to see what they
change to this one this
one hey kids do you have any color
changer trucks you they probably do but
do you have any if you do you might want
to use them this video you know just
like maybe like we're totally not doing
an entire water thing so hey I just have
an idea we should bring that bin outside
and we can use it for our water Stadium
oh yeah we can fill it up with water
yeah yeah okay that's new we can go
around the house too and like look for
more bins to use in our water Arena okay
that sounds
fine okay don't mind me do you like
these or do you want to run them underw
or I I choose these ones you want to run
the newer ones underwater okay all right
so put Oh no just leave them here okay
and then we'll bring that with us let's
do it put all these in
here all right let's do I'm right behind
you buddy
chip
break go should turn the lights
on hot water or cold water hot okay all
right let's guess what color we think
this is going to be when you run it what
do you think turquoise turquoise it's
not warm yet chip break chip
break all right let me run it under a
cold so that we get that cold oh it's
starting to get hot PE
no is it yellow it start up it's yellow
oh it is yellow so what it start off
this orange and then turn to Yellow yep
okay what do you think that's going to
be
black guys I'm right see how right I
am that's black right it's like a camo
right yeah that's cool I actually like
that it's like different stand hey it's
like your shirt your jersey oh yeah PSD
this going to be red obviously
no way I
guess you're just doing like corners of
it yeah well the water's like really hot
I see tail is right on that one it's red
come on you Wim that's not hot oops
let's put that I'm going to guess that
this is going to change Brown okay he's
trying to somehow cheat oh that's not
Brown at all he's trying to cheat and
like look at it so cool you like this
one huh yeah St oh obviously this one's
going to be yellow okay yeah no surprise
on that one cuz it's a like a rubber
ducky yeah he looks like an angry
duck I love this truck why is it Angry
Ducks should be happy duck should not be
angry okay this is going to be a hard
one this is like haul y'all yeah okay

good theme and I just like ducks you

you all for playing did you guys think
that s say was fun rock on dude yep I
think that was fun okay I have a
question for you what's up why is there
a big mound of dirt right there is that
where ants live actually yeah no not uh
we're getting a renovation we're adding
an entire part to our house yeah we're
going to do another another layer sad
cuz we have to move but then we can move
back here yeah we're going to do another
level on our house this
summer
wa okay let's set it up man all right
let's do it pick some pick some ideas
out what do you think I got an idea
already okay I want this Turtle to be
filled with water
okay and then maybe we could use
this and then this okay so
this would start here okay I need this I
need the TR there's no way that this
could jump into the turtle well I just
want to check you know I'm going to
catch it no we did this we did this
video before when we unboxed it we did
this video before when we unboxed it and
then it just kind of landed right here
the hard part was not far but just
Landing it through that Gap okay
so so you could put one of our bins
right here I could do this uh yeah
that's possible that's a good
idea
or whatever whatever you want to do
man the way this one works is you launch
it and you try and break through that to
get in there and if you don't break
through that you fall in in there
H you could put that black Tupperware
right here so that it goes out of the
over the hoop into the water I was just
thinking about like doing this cuz it
like going there okay let's do it okay
we don't need this boat then yeah we
don't need the
boat but does this work do it like does
it work I don't know don't do it don't
do it we'll figure it out okay we we
we'll save it for need this B for our
obstacle
course so next we got these ones we can
so these two go together
yeah we can put these two I want
something that will
like jump from here to there I to place
it that would do that
okay
here we could we could scoot this over
too and then have a little bit room for
something else in here yeah okay so we
have this one do you think this could
make it into the like if we scooted it
closer yeah it could like this yeah we
need to find out we need to experiment
no I don't think we should no but I I we
need to see if it's going to do it I
know it really yeah no no no don't let
the kids know how about I turn the
camera away okay and then we do it and
then the kids won't
know oh I got to turn the camera away
turn the camera away so the kids don't
know we don't know they don't know they
don't know what happened so next up wait
we have to this this doesn't work
anymore now cuz this usually jumps into
that thing unless you want to start off
here we can do whatever we want to do
with it yeah we'll dunk it in water so
that will be like warm water and this
will be like cold water so we'll put it
here and then let make it land right
here okay we'll press this it will go in
the water it will come out onto this go
in more cold water okay come out and
then jump into warm water okay so the
only thing that's going to be in this
turtle is just water yeah pretty much
okay so after that we've got um let's
see
here we have these containers too Caleb
I'll leave these here so you can see
them so let's make a stadium oh we could
put water in this yeah we put the water
in the middle we'll just do the stadium
here cuz it's probably the biggest oh
that's cool we could just have a stadium
and then they just trying to always get
in here and get in the water put this
here what is this it's just a ton of
stuff it's it's not makeup it looks like
makeup yeah it does look home is where
your makeup
is uh no you have that shoe box man The
Shoe Box it's somewhere in here look
it's somewhere in here okay
this is to answer your question this is
a bunch of crunch
cars and just kind of fun stuff like
barrels that we can
put this is
good I don't know why I like doing that
just makes my mouth feel better it's
like like you know the spring is like
yes okay you
to the hospital look at this is kind of
cool this is like a launcher thing oh
wait hold up look at this turn away turn
away turn away turn turn away okay we
have this thing we have this
launcher we have this
thing just fun
ramps what's he doing he's doing
something kids we going to move this
somewhere just leave it there at the
table but just have it like the other
way yeah like that's the way the truck
is designed no it isn't you need this
way yeah okay yeah and there like hooks
in there we have to tape this down cuz
when we made the video where we unboxed
this thing it always like moved around
yeah
like you're trying to get in here set
that back up all right oh you going to
use that in there okay cool don't do it
don't do it
orange orange again it's going back yeah
it's fine okay um Caleb I had an idea
over here sorry to cut into your video
what look at we could use this as the
way they get to the top of the
table like you start down here and then
launch it up onto the table wait where's
table Bo table how about this table okay
what how do you oh you
like we could do like
this okay that's cool I didn't even
think about it like that cuz there's
like a little ramp yeah no that's
awesome that's a great
idea every time you
get every time you get a good idea I'm
going to say
go here's the shoe box one remember you
said you want that oh yes the sh
box hi
Charlene so this one I've got a good
idea so that's that's a launcher pretty
much oh yeah you should put one right
here you should put like something right
here for it to launch in oh okay I was
thinking this is like five coins okay
this is
like okay that could work this is like
one point that's easy this is one wait
does that work like if
I that work okay so this is one
point this is where's our this this is
two
points this is three points no this is
three points no this is three points no
this is three points this is four points
and then this is Five Points oh it's
like ski it's like ski ball you know
like at the arcades but with the monster
truck but with a monster truck ski
ball and he has three tries to beat uh
some sort of record this is going to be
like impossible I have
no I have no faith in I think we got
this all set up except for we have one
more table Yeah I have an idea for it
okay we got two things here we got one
thing here we could maybe get something
small here and then we got this ski ball
we got a stadium what's your idea this
is the Fun Station so we're going to put
this table actually like over here okay
um we're going to put sprinkler here so
you with the hose we can put a sprinkler
there and then you there's like a ton of
ramps and then you can just do it for
like fun you're going to get wet though
yeah I'm going to get wet TI or we could
just put we can just put the sprinkler
like on the edge so that just is right
here and then you just have fun here and
don't get wet I was thinking just like a
stadium and then there's a sprinkler in
the middle we don't have a sprinkler we
just have that thing when you do a bunch
of balloons and then you like all the
balloons fall off and then you just have
what's left over that's all we have
okay you have an idea
yeah you can put the hold let's
we no we can't scoot we have to scoot
this table no okay so we're just going
to put
this right here okay and you have
to jump and then hit the sprinkler so
you have to jump from here go in the
water the hot water your white I mean
yellow your your yellow you go and then
you have to hit and go through the
sprinkler so hit this thing down no just
keep this thing down keep it down you
want to go through the sprinkler and
then go off the table yeah wait hold up
this yeah we can do that okay we might
have to scooch we have to scooch this
table that way yeah and we have to
scooch this closer to the sprinkler all
right so we got our tape here tape it
like that going to tape it right here
and there's going to be sprinkler right
here it's going to be shouting going to
put this here and then you got to go
through it yes all right right can you
tape it yes I can tape it can I yeah you
can we'll find
out I wish you could remove this piece
you don't like it there yeah cuz it's
like cuz have oh we don't even need this
piece yeah I guess if you're just
shooting it through the sprinkler
yeah no no don't do it don't do it it
has to be everything has to be a
surprise okay
okay okay let's keep going so we got
this thing
down where's the duck going to start uh
the duck will just start at the first
table I it's put there oh with a red
slide
yes
so I have an idea do we have any more
water bins oh where's that let's use
this water
bin we can have it right here and then
get that Tower play set that collapses
when you hit it and then it'll fall into
that water
bin this
one what how does it
fall okay yeah yeah just like that
exactly like that tape it down right
where it is right there I'll get the
tape oh I got the tape
du so like right here okay let's tape it
down I'm going to get the water and my
dad's going to uh I mean I'm going to
take the tape everything down and he's
going to get the water okay and you got
to get a lot of water for that Turtle
yeah it's definitely getting late so we
got to make sure we got about about huh
is this supposed to be a pool or a
Sandbox it can be whatever you want I
guess okay so we'll do this in about 5
10 minutes and then we'll do our
obstacle course just one time with Duck
and Roll y oh you know what we should do
while we do this we should go look at
the kids fan mail okay sure let's
go this is our fan mail we've got a ton
of it now I don't see it I don't see I
just see Bluey she's our
