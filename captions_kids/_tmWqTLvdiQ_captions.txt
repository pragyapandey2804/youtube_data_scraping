[Music]
[Applause]
book guys look what I found it's it's an
old
book wo that looks ancient I wonder
what's inside I don't know tofu maybe we
shouldn't mess with it it looks kind of
creepy come on Sam it's Halloween what's
the worst that could happen
what's
happening let's get out of here now
[Music]
that was
terrifying what was that those lights
were like nothing I've seen before I I
knew we shouldn't have opened that book
we need to forget about
it guys
look H how did it get here we left it at
the house I I don't like this at all
but we have to see what's inside maybe
it'll explain what's going
[Applause]
on
Vern zura what does that even
[Music]
mean do you see that that's a ghost
right behind you tofu the there
everywhere we'll have to do
something hey guys what's going on in
here y'all look like y'all have seen a
ghost dear we did see ghosts they're all
around us what are you talking about I
don't see anything
[Music]
Tia we opened this weird book and now
we're seeing all these creepy things we
need your
help okay calm down if the book is
causing this we need to put it back
where you found it maybe that'll stop
whatever's
[Music]
happening are you sure this will work
dear it's worth a try we have to undo
whatever we did by opening
[Music]
it it is it over have all the ghosts
gone
[Applause]
[Music]
it worked we're
safe I'm never opening a strange book
again you learned a valuable lesson tofu
sometimes it's best to leave things
alone especially things we don't
understand Halloween is supposed to be
fun not
[Music]
dangerous I'm so glad we got rid of that
book
that was the scariest thing I've ever
experienced yeah but it was also kind of
cool in a totally terrifying way thanks
for helping us diaa we couldn't have
done it without you always remember
curiosity is a good thing but it's
important to know when to be
cautious some Mysteries are better left
unsolved and safety should always come
first even on Halloween I'll stick to
the candies and costumes from now
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
on the dead end
this is going to be the best road trip
ever I can't wait to get to The
Farmhouse I heard the area around the
farmhous is super spooky perfect for
Halloween I just hope we don't get lost
it's already getting dark don't worry
Sam we'll be fine we've got the GPS and
I know the way
[Music]
danger ahead sounds like an adventure to
me it's Halloween we have to check it
out ah I don't know guys maybe we should
turn back it's probably just an old sign
let's keep going but stay alert if it
gets too weird we'll turn
[Music]
around this place gives me the creeps
why are the lights flickering
it's just the car acting up right
everyone stay calm it's just the
road we'll be at The Farmhouse
soon why did the car stop Tia start the
car we need to get out of here
[Music]
[Music]
what was that something's on the roof
stop the Cara hurry
[Music]
[Applause]
up what was that thing it was
huge it's chasing us go faster dear
did we lose it are we safe now H I think
so but we need to get to The Farmhouse
quickly
now did you see that what was it it
looked like a person but it wasn't and
human whatever it was we're not stopping
we'll be safe at The
[Music]
Farmhouse you made it you're safe now
who are
you what was that thing chasing us long
ago a father lost his child on that road
in a terrible accident since then his
Spirit has haunted these Woods trying to
protect travelers from meeting the same
fate so that creature was it him yes and
the shadow you saw was the spirit of his
child it crosses the road every
Halloween searching for a way back
home but they mean you no har they only
want to keep others safe
we crossed the dead end and
survived you were Brave and now you're
safe the spirits will not follow you
[Music]
here we made it tofu let's never take a
road like that again
agreed I've had enough Halloween
adventure for a
lifetime from now on let's only stick to
trick or treating and maybe tell spooky
stories without actually living them
remember guys sometimes the unknown can
be frightening but it's important to
respect the warnings and signs around us
courage and caution can help us navigate
even the scariest situations and
together we can face everything like we
did today happy Halloween
[Music]
the whispering
[Music]
[Music]
Lighthouse are you sure this is a good
idea
