mind
kids magnets have a magical Force so
they can attract things made of
iron toys made of magnets are a lot of
fun but we need to be careful as
well keep magnets away from TVs
computers and phones because magnets can
damage
them also never put magnets in your
mouth so that you won't accidentally
swallow them and don't put them in your
ears or nose as they could seriously
hurt
you please remember
