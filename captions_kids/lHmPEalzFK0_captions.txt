get George to take a bath

bath without spry who had to be around
here somewhere
[Music]
George and there was no way George was
going to admit he lost another
[Music]
toy who had to be here somewhere
[Music]
George
George just as the early bird catches
the worm so does the early monkey catch
the um
[Music]
fish bye-bye
all fishermen have Tales of their
Adventures but George was going to take
pictures oh you look like a regular

wandered in while heading down river on
his way to the
[Music]
ocean you can get his picture tomorrow

lake eels never come to this Lake I'm
going to catch it and take it
[Music]
home you wanted to be the one to catch
it
huh okay it's a contest I'll go get my
equipment
[Music]
George couldn't let Bill catch that poor
lost deal and take it home he had to
catch it
[Music]
first with Mr Quint and all of his
equipment gone George had to find his
own fishing pole fast
ah
[Music]
aha oh
[Music]
this fishing pole was too
slippery it was a nice summer morning so
George was walking the man with a yellow
hat to the
subway sorry I'm walking so fast George
but I can't be
late George well he was when they
started but George had seen something so
amazing
he had to
stop oh there you are did you see a toy
you
want you already have a dinosaur just
like
[Music]
that you want an
oven George never had a toy that could
make
cake sweet delicious cake
[Applause]
I'm sorry George that's expensive and I
I just bought you an expensive toy last
[Music]
week George can we please talk about
this later I'm late for
[Music]
work sorry George but I can't buy every
toy you
[Music]
see be a good little monkey
[Music]
if the Man with the Yellow Hat couldn't
buy it George would have to buy it
himself all he needed was to get a job
and start earning
money but Mr glass didn't need a window
washer
[Music]
today Chef biscetti didn't need a dish
dryer it was was one of those days when
nobody needed a monkey's
[Music]
help the new summer display is really
going to attract customers dad the palm
tree goes there beach balls on the wall
and Hawaiian lays
everywhere I like it good work son it'll
take me a few hours to pick up
everything we'll set it up when I get
back I could use two more hands while
you're
gone if you had two more hands you'd be
like
George I only wish I could get an
employee with four
hands
[Music]
h an employee with four hands here was
someone who really needed a
monkey the grosser would be so happy
with monkey
help George would probably earn that
whole oven in one day
[Music]
hey do you work
here perfect I need to choose bananas
could you help
me they need to be super sweet I'm
baking a banana cream pie for my mom
oh George knew one sure way to find the
sweetest tasting
bananas these bananas belonged under the
counter not on top how about about the
bunch behind
[Music]
you not the bananas in front of you the
ones
[Music]
behind try the bananas behind
[Music]
them a
[Music]
thanks this is the best service I've
ever had in any
[Music]
store there's nothing an inquisitive
monkey likes more than discovering new
things and the Museum's a great place
for
discoveries like how different something
can seem when you look at just a small
part of
[Music]
it hi
[Music]
George you're getting a close look at
our dinosaur exhibit I
see then you'll be interested in this
this newly discovered stegosaur or a
skeleton is our next
[Music]
exhibit discovering dinosaur bones look
like the best job in the
world the museum always gave George lots
to think
about unlike chy who only ever thought
about one
[Music]
thing
[Music]
[Music]
playing he discovered a
bone that magnifying glass would have
come in handy but chy was probably
blocks away by now
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
George couldn't let chy chew on it what
if some dinosaur lost this bone on its
way to the museum
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
huh the stegosaurus had all his
[Music]
bones so did the Triceratops
[Music]
and the
Tyrannosaurus if a dinosaur hadn't lost
it what kind of bone could it
[Music]
be a
[Music]
luckily there was always a box of
hunley's treats in the
[Music]
lobby no
no good morning
George I'm going to sleep 5 more minutes
okay
[Laughter]
no this hry this ha roller coaster whips
and snaps your own hair pin turns at 70
mph so come on down to Z Island and ride
the turbo python 3000 that's Captain's
orders oh well that looks uh very
exciting George anyway we have a lot of
errands to run today I you
[Music]
know like I was saying I'll get dressed
so we can spend a fun day at zany Island
riding the turbo python 3000
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
now don't eat all that licorice at once
okay George
H hi Steve Betsy hello
George hey have you guys been on the
turbo python 3000 we've been on nine
times already that's the
record is it um fun he screamed his head
off nine times we're gonna ride it all
day want to
[Music]
[Applause]
come everyone was excited about riding
the turbo python
3000 except the man with a yellow hat he
was afraid of roller coasters and
remembered the first and last time he
rode a roller
coaster it was so long ago he was just
the boy with the Yellow Hat
[Music]
and since that day roller coasters upset
him okay I'm a grown man I have no
reason to fear a roller
[Applause]
coaster uh enjoy the ride
georgeo I am thirsty
[Music]
excuse me I'm sorry but you can't ride
the turbo python
3000 H well you have to be as tall as
this sign to ride and uh you're
not sorry
pal that goes for you too son
[Music]
[Applause]
H do you mind if we ride without you
uh
[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
yeah sorry I measure to the top of a
head not the top of a
hat you're going to have to really grow
before you can ride there little fella
George wondered exactly how much he had
to
grow but when he measured with his hand
he was the same height as the sign he
must have grown
already you're not measuring right I
wish I had a ruler or
something I just
H see 1 2 3 4 5 the sign is five
licorice whips tall and you
are 1 2 3 4 licorice whips
tall you can come back when you're
growing one more Licorice Whip tall and
until then enjoy the rest of the park
[Music]
when spring is in the air there's
nothing a monkey likes more than to
Spring in the air
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
to keep his Lobby orderly Hunley always
kept a close eye on
[Music]
[Applause]
George come on George
[Music]
I wish I had your energy
[Music]
George just watching George made Hunley
[Music]
tired hello Professor
wisman hi what do you have George your
favorite kind of
[Music]
dinosaur oh that's your favorite but
they're the same those are the bones
that would be inside that you know same
as the bones in
[Music]
you feel your arm the hard part that's
bone it's your skeleton
[Music]
now that he knew he had one of those
under his face George had to see the
T-rex skull up
close George don't it isn't
[Music]
safe are you okay I'm going now
[Music]
W George always wanted to ride in an
ambulance but he couldn't really enjoy
it at the hospital Dr Baker decided they
needed to see George's leg bone by
taking an
x-ray that's a small break we have to
put your leg in a
cast now this chest will keep your leg
from moving while the bone
[Music]
heals hey that looks like
George Hunley knew what to do when he
heard that
name he got ready to defend the Dignity
of his
Lobby poor little guy is he all right oh
yeah but he's going to be out of action
for
weeks no
jumping no noise Hunley wasn't so sure
this was
George well
hello you have a visitor George
it was George all right no one else in
the building smelled like
that hello Hunley come up here yeah
we're in George's
room you know in the lobby Hunley pays
more attention to George than anyone
that's
friendship a Hunley could keep George
company when you go to work I'd excuse
him from his Lobby
duties true George would you like Hunley
to be your monkey
[Music]
sitter George thought the country house
was a great little
place but he wondered what would it be
like to have a great big
place o
like a country
[Music]
Castle George look what I
found my old photo
[Music]
album oh that boy that's
me anyway this got me thinking I haven't
been to the beach in a long time you
want to go we can build sand
castles well I don't know if we could
build a sand castle quite that nice but
that can't stop us from
[Laughter]
trying um
George I take it this means you'd like
to go to the beach
[Music]
all the way there George worked on
Castle
[Music]
plans he wanted it to be
perfect George we're here
smell that salty
[Music]
air
[Music]
[Music]
George George hadn't planned on having
so much room to build a castle
with this kind of space he could really
think
big George wait
[Music]
up let me know when you find a good idea
for a castle he wouldn't build just any
old ordinary little Sam Castle George
said he built his sand castle around
here somewhere
[Music]
wow could this be George's sand
castle
hello anyone
home George it's me
[Music]
George it's the greatest sand castle any
monkey ever made ever
anywhere now he knew exactly what his
castle should look like and that he
wanted it to be a
surprise oh you want to build a castle
like that
one oh you want to build a castle here
and me to build one down there then we
surprise each other that the
idea okay that sounds
[Music]
fun you need a paale and shovel if
you're going to build a sand
castle George thought he had to build
the whole thing with his hands this
would be easier than he
thought I can give you a few
tips oh okay well I'll be behind the
next d so you can't see what I'm
[Music]
building George's Castle was going to be
a big surprise very
[Music]
big first he marked exactly where the
walls would
[Music]
go then he decided where he'd put the
door you should always know your exits
in case of
fire now came the easy
part building
[Music]
It Summer
Afternoon the perfect time for a game of
find the pigeon
[Music]
okay George play time's over time to
clean your
room you can play with compass after you
clean your room
[Music]
bath time
[Music]
George I don't think you'll fit in the
bird bath George you're definitely a tub
monkey
[Music]
okay time to brush your teeth and hit
the sack
[Music]
George even though being a monkey was
the greatest thing ever pigeons didn't
have to do what anybody told
them George time to clean your room take
a bath wash your ears brush your teeth
go to bed wake up make yourself
breakfast
[Music]
[Music]
George so the next morning George made
up his mind to live like a pigeon
[Music]
ow it turned out that birds had special
pecking
[Music]
[Music]
equipment keeping up with pigeons was
hard work if you didn't come with wings
plus pigeons didn't have to wait for the
don't walk light
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
George had lost his
flock to be a pigeon you had to
[Music]
fly being a cat looked like a lot less
work than being a
[Music]
pigeon now this was the
life and no no one made noi clean her
[Music]
room plus cats took a bath wherever they
wanted whenever they
wanted a cat bath was
okay if you didn't mind a hairy mouth
and a spitty
face Maybe being a cat wasn't for George
either
here were lots of animals who didn't
have to clean their rooms or brush their
teeth surely George could find one he
could be like a
chameleon they could change color
[Music]
effortlessly monkeys couldn't
fish never had to stop playing to take a
[Music]
bath but George wasn't good enough at
holding his breath to be a fish for very
long a sunny day in a garden project
meant one thing to Curious
[Music]
George that ought to softened it up a
bit have had it George
[Music]
make the hole good and deep George we
don't want the roots to dry
up George was an old dirt digging Pro
but this time he saw something he'd
never noticed
before there were things living in this
dirt uh whoa whoa uh where are you going
with those worms
[Music]
George we've been through this before
remember the
[Music]
turtle George remembered the turtle all
right it happened the first time he went
swimming in Lake Wyn lake with
Bill here you go George
[Music]
[Music]
can you see it stick your head under and
look
around George had never put his whole
head in a real Lake
before George win in the
lake and the lake win in George
George you
okay when you're underwater you got to
hold your breath like
[Music]
this see now you try
[Music]
it good job did you see it
you city kids you got to open your eyes
if you want to see anything here use my
mask it keeps the water out of your eyes
so it's easier to see down
there boy are you in for a surprise it's
like a zoo down
[Music]
there bill was right there were so many
different living things it was like a
zoo except
[Music]
wet what I tell you great
huh they live down there just like we
live up here some animals breathe in
water like we breathe on
land oh I got to do my paper
out keep looking George if you need
anything ask Mr
Quint Turtles lived on land just like
people and monkeys but did they know to
hold their
breath George didn't and he was pretty
sure he was smarter than a turtle
[Music]
George tried to teach the turtle what
he'd learned then realized it was
silly Turtles don't have
[Music]
thumbs so he told it to stay out of the
water for its own good
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
huh George was so busy keeping the
turtle safe he had no time to
search why did he keep trying to go
in suddenly it was
clear that Turtle needed a
bath George had toys for summer and toys
for snow but there were no toys for just
playing
cold there weren't even Birds to
watch but even the dullest monkey day
could be saved by a visit with
[Music]
bunnies the hutch was empty there must
have been a big bunny Breakout
[Music]
[Laughter]
what's wrong George oh are you looking
for the bunnies uhhuh ah don't worry I
brought them in out of the cold
oh I'm glad you're here we have to go to
my grandmother's can you do me a favor
while I'm gone George knew bill was
going to ask him to take care of the
bunnies it's something he dreamed about
[Music]
George would pick only videos that
bunnies liked and games they could win
and show them his best bunny picture
books I'm taking the bunnies to stay at
my grandmother's house for the rest of
the
winter well it's too cold out and my
folks won't let me keep them in the
house Grandma has a warm place they can
spend the entire
[Music]
winter so could you do me a favor and
put out some nuts and seeds for that
jumpy squirrel every day I don't want
him to go hungry if the ground gets too
cold and hard and he can't find
[Music]
food see you later George
[Music]
[Applause]
George remembered how it was not too
long
[Music]
ago why did all fun things have to be
taken away just because of some old
[Music]
season he wasn't going to let winter
ruin his well ruin his winter
this little monkey was going to prove
that winter couldn't stop him from doing
whatever he
[Music]
wanted really cold water can change a
monkey's plans just like
that George I'm back I bought some of
that really good hot cocoa
[Music]
what are you
doing soaking your feet in warm water
because you got to
[Music]
chill well when it's too cold to play
outside it's hot coco to the rescue
[Music]
[Applause]
the next day felt like the coldest day
of the
year don't forget your
[Music]
scarf but George was not about to let it
stop him from having fun the way he
wanted
to time for fun
[Music]
George had won he was having fun like
winter had never come
[Applause]
[Music]
it was a special day for George a visit
to the museum but first a stop at piset
for a sweet Sunday
treat George they're not going
[Music]
anywhere canoli a brown crunchy shell
with a delicious
filling see two just for
[Music]
us hey noi you have your own house now
[Music]
[Music]
someone's looking for canoli the last
two got taken
I'm sorry I don't make any new canoli
today I'm too upset what's going
on
muar she has been sneaking into the main
room and scratching up at the seats it's
a
disaster you see look what she has
done can you believe a little g a sweet
little kitty could do such damage
[Music]
[Music]
I must ban from the
restaurant oh well we saw the house you
buil her it's very nice gry I plan to
add a second
story oh that is y she wants to come in
I feel terrible she only wants to come
in because you say she cannot oh typical
cat this kitchen is in
torment I suspect there will be no
canoli until this problem is
solved back outside
[Music]
oh don't worry George I'm sure they'll
solve the
[Music]
problem at the Museum George was too
distracted to
[Music]
concentrate ah Professor wisman hey guys
welcome to my new exhibit it's called
how great science scientists got their
great ideas these are portraits of some
great
scientists Isaac Newton Benjamin
Franklin Marie curri and Albert Einstein
once you think like a scientist George
you can solve almost any problem George
had a problem he wanted
canoli you know scientists think about
problems and get ideas to solve them
they observe then collect information
and if that information doesn't help
solve their problem they observe more
and get a different
idea oh dear excuse me young man get
down from
there George wondered what great
scientists would do if they were monkeys
who had no canoli because noi had
scratched the
booths I say do we know for certain that
she did it like the chef believes you
must think about what you observe
H George did see Noki scratch the door
but could she have scratched the booth
too What You observe does not support
the chef's idea about noi making disc
scates if George could prove noi was
innocent Chef pisti would be happy and
George would have
canoli oh I love
canoli George had to observe
more The Man with the Yellow Hat and
George visited Professor wisman hi guys
this is the final draft of my new book
would you proof read it and check to
make sure everything's spelled right

wisman would be so

especially when he got a plum
reward the man went home but George
chose to stay out in case he could do
more
good and get more
rewards that friendly woman forgot a
package here was his chance to earn
rewards George sure picked the right
person to
[Music]
help she left another package
[Music]
behind Hunley didn't know what George
was doing but if he was leaving whatever
it was wouldn't be happening here this
time George was starting to think how
lucky she was to have someone with the
brain of a monkey to help
[Music]
cuz boy was she forgetful
