Crashing waves but I’ll never fall
Everyday, supernatural
Thrashing rain Imma bring the storm
This my stage, walkin on water
Water water walkin on
Water water walk it off
Water water walkin on
This my stage, my stage
I’m walkin on water
You can call me Harry Potter
I just take all forms Imma fill up my bottle
My flow rushes like a wild current 
Even on a downhill I still go upstream
I’ve climbed up to a place not anyone can stand on
I’m naturally hard working, that’s all of me 
Not to cut the flow stomp stomp
Make it flow, make it flow, make it go far
Splash
Pitter-patter, feel the water
Crash
Chitter-chatter, we’re just gonna
Dance
Walker walker, I’m sea walkin
Imma flow, Imma flow on the water
Woah
(Water water walkin on)
When you’re sinking I’m fishing
That’s my flow
(Water water walk it off)
Imma flow, Imma flow on the water
Dive, we do ride, we don’t hide
Water splashes all around, as we move
You’re confused and out of breath trying to catch up with me
You thought this would be easy? 
(Listen up now fellas)
Say hello to Nemo ’cause I can’t see
Walking smoothly we look like a Basilisk
Water splashing everywhere as we move, splash
This is under my control call me Aqua Man
On the waves, we just play
We’re up here, no hurdles in our way
So stay, join the game
We ain’t gonna fall down deep into the water
Splash
Pitter-patter, feel the water
Crash
Chitter-chatter, we’re just gonna
Dance
Walker walker, I’m sea walkin
Imma flow, Imma flow on the water
Woah
(Water water walkin on)
When you’re sinking I’m fishing
That’s my flow
(Water water walk it off)
Imma flow, Imma flow on the water
Crashing waves but I’ll never fall
Everyday, supernatural
Thrashing rain Imma bring the storm
This my stage, walkin on water
Crashing waves but I’ll never fall
Everyday, supernatural
Thrashing rain Imma bring the storm
This my stage, walkin on water
Water water walkin on
Water water walk it off
Water water walkin on
This my stage, walkin on water
(Water water water water water)
