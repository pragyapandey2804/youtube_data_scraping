Put ’em up
We need to give it our all tonight 
Put ’em up, Put ’em up, Put ’em up
The music will wake me up again & again & again
ULTRA SOUND
ULTRA MIC
ULTRA MIND
ULTRA LIFE
ULTRA POWER
I got a shot called ULTRA
ULTRA
ULTRA
ULTRA ULTRA
I’m feeling ULTRA ULTRA 
(Feelin’ like Banner)
ULTRA ULTRA
I’m feeling ULTRA ULTRA 
There’s no limit
All the stress I was clinging to
I threw it all away like a piece of trash
Be free from the pain
Break a chain
A newly born monster
My booster’s on, ‘cause I was born to stand apart
I stretch out my arms
Climbing to new heights
But I keep running 
Without a break  
The scars 
might cut deep
But in the end
I’ll Switch it up for higher worth
There’s no such thing as enough
This is my law
Maxing out the thrill of achievement
Layer on layer of perfection on me
Put ’em up
We need to give it our all tonight 
Put ’em up, Put ’em up, Put ’em up
The music will wake me up again & again & again

ULTRA ULTRA
I'm feeling ULTRA ULTRA
There’s no limit
Everyone around me was in chaos
Adrenaline rushing
I’m just rockin’ on my microphone
They were gritting their teeth behind me
I just worked hard like a little ant
I overcame the pain and became a giant
ULTRA

ULTRA ULTRA
I'm feeling ULTRA ULTRA 
(Feelin’ like Banner)
ULTRA ULTRA
I'm feeling ULTRA ULTRA 
There’s no limit
