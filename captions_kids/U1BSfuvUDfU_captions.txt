can you hear that reason in my heart
want to show you want to share with you
feel The Vibes let's light it up
tonight got a singing that's like never
did before
hey can you see the lights turning music
all the way up way up heyo
welcome to the Stars let them know that
we get the party started it's party time
a r t y b a r t y b a r t y p a r t
y was it time it's time to have some fun
Can you feel it the body going up grab
your friends we're waiting for you now
there's no time to explain just be on
top raise a bar shine like a star be
yourself be who you are together raise
the bar shine like the star be yourself
be who you are some fun b a r t y b a r
