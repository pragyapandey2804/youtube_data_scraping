then maybe it's like a a tombstone or
something here we can open it yeah let's
dig it up let me take a close of it okay
take a closer look take a closer look
what wait let's flip it over a flip it
over flip it
over ah nothing here let me let me dig
wait we could keep digging
yeah and see we see some let see if we
see a
fossil all right nothing there's got to
be something here because there was did
you see that did you see that yeah I saw
something it was like a yeah right there
right there
there yeah did you see that it's a white
it's a white what is it it's it's a
tooth wait let me spray it let me spray

keep keep give me the brush here give me
the brush I got it I'll brush I'll brush
it out
yeah it looks like a is it to looks like
a to it's a d tooth a dinosaur
tooth we can't get it out does it look
like a
Triceratop H maybe from a titter titter
yeah a titter a
Triceratop calls it a tit this don't
know wao wait wait wait Mary look it
it's super
big it is don't break it wait it's from
a TX careful paleontologist have to be
careful it's from a T-Rex how do you get
this thing out sometimes you have to
brush out it's m you think it's a
T-Rex wait I think I know what it is
it's
a
w it's a bir it's a giant bird it's a
giant bird that's why that's it's a
fossil
wow here let me spray it okay clean

bird and then I'll scrubble it let me
scrubble it what does scrubble mean let
her scrubble it let her scrubble SC now
we need to clean it
okay I thought
the burn B from many years ago
yeah all right let's put it let's put it
in our truck
and then let's keep looking for more
yeah and then we can find more fossil
bones let's look yeah why was that so
hard to get out cuz these are thousands
and thousands and years old millions of
years old billions billions of years old
that they're deep in the Earth the
latest the earliest how we could find it
and then we we look in there yeah how
did we find them I found it because I I
saw like I saw Rock I'm like
that kind of looks like a foxa oh good
job we got to keep our eyes out yeah
come on let's go this way let's search
around over here a little bit more
ow I'm a looker what's
this it's a it's a something oh it's
more
hieroglyphics here let's look at the
hieroglyphics okay what is it sh out
it's like uh
someone look at it's someone's shooting
uh a some fat
unicorn I think it's a caveman or a cave
woman or something maybe all let's sck
up the
rest actually know that what the what
the oh what you're just grabbing bones
you're just grabbing B is it a club get
in there is it a
club I found that reason it's a hand
what you going to get some water on that
yeah let's get some water yeah let's get
some water let me see what you got let
me see what you got it's a hand what
this supposed to be a hand this is
supposed to be a hand
oh maybe he lost his hand in battle no I
found maybe maybe a dinosaur lost a in
in a battle now it's easier to dig
up is it coming out not working wait
maybe this maybe it's suppos to go this
way try
now watch out
Mary now let me take a closer look at
that okay take a closer
look it must be from a dinosaur I think
it's from a human yeah yeah yeah man
from gu from a skeleton yeah it looks
like a human skeleton but look look look
at it look at it's the arm how can see
what is this maybe it's from a skeleton
hand can you can you use this can you
use your chisel right here yeah and see
if you can break break it off yeah see
if you can break it off the
scrubble I'll get the get the
scrubble okay do
it if it was like that it could be a
clue ah so hard it is hard here let me
let me try getting it more my water okay
it doesn't
work what is this I'm getting it in here
so maybe it'll get loose and then we can
pull it out it off
okay wait maybe you could use this look
look what I'm doing you should be able
to get it now see look it it like
erases oh wa got it ah I'm only going to
be covered in there after this
keep
going is this is this kind of trick like
maybe it's been it's been in the Earth
for thousands and millions of years it's
like Frozen in years fre must be from a
tyan tyan maybe it's from from Tyran
tyan a tanon or T-rex yeah a you want to
just pour this on here yeah sure let's
just do
that it out out of his arm of a skeleton
arm yeah it's coming oh yeah you can
definitely see it now it's a skeleton
arm now I found that skeleton it's a
skeleton hand wait no no it's from an
old dinosaur maybe a dinosaur maybe give
it to me give it to me it's hard to say
from the hieroglyphics give it to me
like maybe it's the din maybe it's this
dinosaur or a buffalo or maybe it's that
do you think there's more hey here guys
I think this is from a skeleton H maybe
maybe it's from a man long ago yeah wait
is that a handprint look here look it

ath claw or a tooth it's got to be a
claw cuz a tooth is like pointy but this
is like see that little hole yeah that
