I tried to do my best
I ran, only looking straight ahead
But I tripped and fell
And ended up falling behind
Why does this only happen to me 
Right before tears came to my eyes 
You were crying next to me 
Ah even if we’re a little slow 
Even if we get lost in the dark sometimes
Until you and I who are similar, reach the finish line
Let’s run through time together 
Even if it snows 
And the wind blows
So strongly that our bodies tremble
Let’s put down our roots,
Spread our branches
And wait for one more one more day  
As long as we stay
In our own way
I dream of 
The freshest, brightest day to come
Ah, even if we look imperfect
Even if we’re compared to others at times
I’m always on your side
Until we reach the finish line
Let’s run through time together 
Even if it snows 
And the wind blows
So strongly that our bodies tremble
Let’s put down our roots,
Spread our branches
And wait for one more one more day  
As long as we stay
In our own way
I dream of 
The freshest, brightest day to come
Back then
You were by my side
So I was able to hold on
I was able to make it in the end
Without feeling lonely
For all that time
Like that, on the day, let’s 
Look at each other
With the brightest smile
As we are
As we are
