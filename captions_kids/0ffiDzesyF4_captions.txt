some magic tricks come
on
W I can't believe it we're inside an
actual magic
shop wo and look at this
you know what this
is It's a magician's hat
whoo maybe a rabbit will come out of
this or something
else maybe I'll try that on
later oh and look at this woo look it's
a blue scarf yeah sometimes magicians
use props yeah those are things that
help them do magic like a scarf woo woo
there's a green one
woo and an orange one woo wo and look at
this it's a light blue one W woo hey can
you think of anything else that's also

whale well let's see if we can find some
other things here W wo check it out yeah

Halloween oo wa yeah it looks so cool
here yeah everyone is all ready for the
holiday hey guess what's
here we found it yeah the perfect
addition to my costume this is a magic
wand who yeah look at it
[Music]
yeah the magic wand helps a magician do
tricks kind of like the scarves or those
magic cups but this is the most
important
thing H well this is a lot of fun
exploring the shop but think I need a
little help to become a better magician
yeah magicians yeah all the tricks they
do mhm takes a lot of practice and I
think having a teacher would help me
practice so I can do some amazing tricks
for
halloweeno maybe we can find one over
here H but first we need to say the
magic
words
H I know the perfect magic words are you
ready here we go silly
potato W it actually worked I think I'm
going to put this down now oh let's say
hi hello I'm blippy what's your name hi
I'm Brent oh it's nice to meet you Brent
well I'm Dred up as a magician for
Halloween and I was hoping to meet a
magician so I could learn how to do some
magic tricks do you know any magicians
well I'm a magician Flippy and I own the
store who you're a real life magician
yes whoa that's awesome well I want to
be the best magician I can be for
Halloween so do you think you could show
us a trick sure I thought yeah I
definitely will but before we start I
thought it'd be fun to have a little
snack so I have some jelly beans here or
a deluxe mixed nuts which one would you
like well I can't wait to eat some yummy
nuts yeah cashews and almonds and H all
kinds of things it's kind of stuck on
there those aren't mixed nuts wa those
aren't mixed nuts either well I'm still
kind of hungry for a snack good thing I
brought some from home okay hm salted
mixnuts oo these look so
tasty maybe I'll have a snack
later well that was really fun oh and
what's this right here Brent well this
is a little magic trick I thought I
would show you I've got a magic wand
that will place right there and I've got
a block with the letter c on it wo it's
a blue block with the letter c hey can
you think of a word that starts with a
letter C hm maybe cat
or
caterpillar and another one with the
letter B oh the letter B oh just like
blippy oh or
Brent I like that one and of course a a
yeah that's a really important letter
it's the first letter of the alphabet A
B
C and I have a very magical box here
blippy there's nothing inside the box
here we'll use that in a second and
since your name starts with be and my
name starts with be I'll show you this
empty tube keep your eye on that green
block do you know any magic words H I
sure do blippity Dippity
pop look at
this W the bee disappears wao check it
out hello huh there's nothing in here
who where'd it go I believe my empty box
yep it has a little magic
be yeah that was awesome whoa Brent
you're an amazing magician W he moves
the Bee from the magic wand into the box
with
magic well that was so fun well I'm
already starting to feel like a real
magician do you think you could show me
another trick sure let's learn a new
trick and I'll teach it to you wo I get
to learn a trick on my own yeah let's do
it wa now we get to learn trick number
two so Brent what is this trick well
this one's a coin trick and it's called
closeup magic close up magic is is that
because you're really close to someone
yeah some things are smaller like a coin
trick is smaller than the trick we did
over there which is a parlor magic trick
wa so it's a little bit bigger yeah
exactly and then there's also stage
magic where they do illusions wo and I
bet that's really really really big it's
huge stuff so let's do a close-up magic
trick for you and your friends okay
let's watch I have one penny here and if
you watch really closely it's not you
can't buy a lot of stuff with a penny
with a little bit of magic I can do this
hopefully and then have two quarters
just like that from one penny to two
quarters wo that was amazing did you see
that yeah there was just one penny yeah
just one cent and then it turned into
two quarters wao two quarters 50 cents
that's a lot of sense do you want to
learn that magic trick mhm yeah okay
definitely would like to learn it so
that it makes a little more
sense so you have to promise not to tell
the secrets of the magic trick that what
makes a good magician is not telling how
the trick works oh well I want to be a
really good magician so yeah okay so
raise the hand that you write with okay
and say I promise I promise not to tell
the secrets not to tell the secrets of
the coin trick of the coin trick and if
I do tell the secrets and if I do tell
the secrets then I will be in I will be
in
big trouble
trouble I don't want to be in trouble so
what you're going to need blippy is
you're going to need a quarter okay and
then another quarter oh and then then a
penny so you need those three items to
make this trick work okay so before you
start your magic trick you're going to
put the penny in between your first
finger and your thumb oo and then behind
that Penny kind of like a t the two
quarters go like that so from the front
of the coin it looks like there's one
penny but from the side there's two
quarters W so you have be careful to
watch your
angles to make sure nobody's on this
side of you or on this side of you but
straight on like you are whoa yeah so
the quarters are hiding in the back
they're hiding in the back exactly yeah
I can't see them so you say to your
friend look I have one penny there's not
much you can buy with one penny and then
when you cover up the penny with your
hand woo just like that you're going to
secretly push this Penny behind the two
quarters and and show the two quarters
wa that's amazing yeah look the penny is
hiding behind one of the quarters
because the penny is smaller than the
quarter oh yeah see a teeny tiny Penny
but a little bit bigger quarter
woo W Brent that's an amazing illusion
so now you've learned a magic trick
you're on your way to becoming a
magician I can't wait 1 2 3
I can still see you

wo all right let's set this down right
here hey the first thing I noticed
that's in here are pumpkins yeah a
pumpkin SK is circle wo look at these
two wo and these two hey they each have
a face on them this looks like a scared
pumpkin
W okay this pumpkin looks
sad all right what does this pumpkin
look like
happy and this pumpkin looks
mad okay I think we should put these
pumpkins on the front
[Music]
porch oh I have an idea why don't we put
one happy pumpkin right here yeah hello
happy pumpkin and then over here we can
put let's see let's do the opposite of
happy which is sad
M all right then we have two more
pumpkins let's put a mad
pumpkin right here perfect and then
we'll put the
scared or the surprise pumpkin right
here there you go you stay right there
all right let's go see what other
decorations we have
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
wa all right we have a lot more
decorations all right let's see we have
some toilet paper we have some cones we
have a
chain
oo look what kind of animal is this huh
yeah this is a rat
W and what kind of animal is this wait a
second it's not an animal this is a
giant insect this looks like a
spider okay these are just toys but
let's go put them on the
[Music]
[Applause]
porch all right looks like I found the
perfect place for him let's put him on
the handrail just like
this that rat can go there and then how
about the spider can go right there
perfect oo what else do we have in
here hey remember the toilet
paper I know what we could do with this
we can wrap it around the tree like a
ghost or a mummy or something this is
going to be
fun all right let's go like this
[Music]
[Music]
perfect how does that look it definitely
looks
festive all right let's see what else we
have W there's so many more things in in
here W look another pumpkin I think this
steak can go in the ground yeah see just
like that all right come
[Music]
on let's actually put it right
[Music]
here how does that look yeah the pumpkin
is growing inside of all of these plants
wao yeah now it's back in its
home wo I bet you were wondering what
this is huh wo it's black and red wo it
looks like a big scary
spider wo all right let's go find the
perfect place for it this is going to be
a great decoration
[Music]
I found the perfect
place yeah look it's dangling just like
how spiders dangle from their webs
wo spiders actually put these webs
across branches and trees and Limbs and
plants so then all the web is spread out
so then insects like a fly might fly
into the web so then that's when the
spider can have some
[Music]
food we have so many more great
decorations I love
Halloween it's so cool how a lot of this
is one color yeah the same color over
and over again it's the official color
of Halloween there's actually two black
is one but then you see the other color
of all of
this yeah it's one of my two favorite
colors yeah that's the color orange okay
we have some orange cones right here but
wait a second what can I do with orange
cones they're not very Halloween
is
hey but if we're creative here come on
over
here but if we're creative then we can
probably make something called candy
corn yeah candy corn is a really tasty
candy that you shouldn't eat a lot of it
but it's actually Halloween candy so I'm
going to spray this spray paint which is
only for adults to use okay and I'm in a
a lot of open air cuz it's not good to
breathe it in so any who here I
[Music]
go perfect all right so these cones are
orange and yellow right now but candy
corn are as you can see white
orange and then yellow so I need to do
the tops White
[Music]
who how do these look they look so
tasty all right let's go place them
right over
here okay how about one candy corn right
there perfect and then how about the
other candy corn right over
here
perfect that is awesome
[Music]
wow hey remember when we were talking
about spiders and spider
webs yeah these are spider webs just

them on the
house and act like a spider so we can
spin our own webs let's
[Music]
[Music]
go look it's like I got caught in a
spider
web okay put that down right there that
looks really good we are doing such a
great job okay I think there's just a
couple more
decorations wo look at
this some parts of Halloween are kind of
scary just like this
chain okay well we'll use it anyways all

go how about let's wrap it around just
like this yeah this isn't too scary it's
just a a chain Prett perfect there we go
