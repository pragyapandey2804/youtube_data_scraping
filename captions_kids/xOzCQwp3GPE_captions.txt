salvation the story of Adam and Eve is a
very important Bible story about
trusting and obeying God's
command but who was that Adam and who is
he while today there are millions of men
and women in the world do you know there
was a time when there was no man and
woman in the
world who was a very first man and the
very first
woman let's open the Bible and read
about the creation of Adam and
Eve and let's find out if Adam and Eve
trusted and obeyed
God we go to Genesis
2 at this time God Almighty has created
the heavens and the
Earth and after God created the heavens
and the
Earth and had finished the work he had
been doing on the seventh
day
God rested from all his
work then God blessed the seventh day
and made it
holy because on it he rested from all
the work of creating that he had
done so resting is indeed a good
thing at this time there was no shrub on
the earth and no plant had yet spr
sprung
up for the Lord God had not sent rain on
the earth and there was no one to work
the
ground so no farmers and all those
things humans can do were not done by
humans the streams came up from the
earth and watered the whole surface of
the
ground then the Lord God formed a man
from the dust of the ground and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of
life and a Man became a living
being that man is
Adam now the Lord God had planted a
garden in the east in
Eden and there he put the man he had
formed
the Lord God made all kinds of trees
grow out of the
ground trees that were pleasing to the
eye and good for
food in the middle of the garden were
the tree of life and the tree of the
knowledge of Good and
Evil the Lord God took the man and put
him in the Garden of Eden to work the
land and take care of
it and the Lord God commanded the
man you are free to eat from any tree in
the
garden but you must not eat from the
Tree of the knowledge of Good and
Evil for when you eat from it you will
certainly
die
okay just imagine that you are Adam no
one to talk to no family no
friends Adam must have been very
lonely the Lord God said it is not good
for the man to be
alone I will make a helper suitable for
him now the Lord God had formed out of
the ground all the wild animals and all
the birds in the
sky he brought them to the man to see
what he would name
them and whatever the man called each
living
creature that was its
name so the pig the cow the lion the
rooster and all the names of livestock
the birds in the sky all the wild
animals were given to them by Adam the
first
[Music]
man while we love animals and birds We
crave the relationship of a fellow human
being so none of these animals were
suitable helper for
Adam so the Lord God caused a man to
fall into a deep sleep and while he was
sleeping he took one of the man's ribs
and then closed up the place place with
flesh then the Lord God made a woman
from the rib he had taken out of the man
and he brought her to the
man the man
said this is now bone of my bones and
Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called
woman for she was taken at a
[Music]
man that is why a man leaves his father
and mother and is United to his wife and
they become one
flesh Adam and his wife were both naked
and they felt no
shame everything was going well so
far now the serpent was craftier than
any of the wild animals the Lord God had
made he said to the woman did God really
say You must not eat from any tree in
the garden
the woman said to the serpent we may eat
fruit from the trees in the garden but
God did say you must not eat frood from
the tree that is in the middle of the
garden and you must not touch it or you
will
die you will not certainly die the
serpent said to the woman for God knows
that when you eat from it your eyes will
be opened and you will be like God
knowing good and
evil Eve needed to trust and obey the
Commandment of God however Eve looked at
the forbidden fruit and saw that they
looked fresh and delicious and also
desirable for gaining
wisdom she took some and ate it she also
gave some to her husband who was with
her and he ate
it Adam should have obeyed the
Commandment of God but he fell into the
temptation
then the eyes of both of them were
opened and they realized they were naked
so they sewed fig leaves together and
made coverings for
[Music]
themselves then the man and his wife
heard the sound of the Lord God as he
was walking in the garden in the cool of
the day and they hid from the Lord God
Among the Trees of the garden but the
Lord God Called to the man where are you
he answered I heard you in the garden
and I was afraid because I was naked so
I hid and he said who told you that you
were naked have you eaten from the tree
that I commanded you not to eat
from the man
said the woman you put here with me she
gave me some fruit from the tree and I
ate
it then the Lord God said to the woman
what is this you have done the woman
said a serpent is deceived me and I ate
so Adam tried to blame Eve for making
him eat the fruit and Eve blamed the
serpent for deceiving her but they had
both still disobeyed
him God punished the serpent by taking
away his legs making all serpents crawl
on their bellies in the dirt for all
time and making them Man's
[Music]
enemies God punished Adam and Eve by
banishing them from the Garden of
Eden there are consequences when we
disobey God but when we walk with the
Lord in the light of his word what a
glory he sheds on our
way while we do his good will he abides
with us
still and with all who will trust and
Obey in this Bible story Adam and Eve
should have have obeyed the Lord but
they disobeyed even when they knew it
was wrong to disobey
God in our lives we may face Temptations
Just as Eve always remember to resist
doing bad
things sometimes doing a bad thing may
look like a good choice and sound like
fun or have an immediate gain but there
are consequences for
Disobedience when we trust and Obey not
a shadow can rise not a cloud in the
skies but his smile quickly drives it
away not a doubt or a fear not a sigh or
a tear can abide while we trust and
Obey before you do something ask
yourself if it is a good thing if anyone
will be
disappointed let us pray for the grace
of God to be
obedient dear dear Jesus you have
proclaimed that if we love you we will
keep your Commandments to walk with you
is to avoid
sin your sheep know your voice I am your
little lamb and I will follow you
wherever you go increase my trust in you
and your commands let my ears ever be
listening to your voice help me to trust
you as my only
Shepherd
confident that you will keep me from all
harm and danger in jesus' name I
pray
amen the parable of the Good
[Music]
Samaritan I am the light of the world
and Behold a lawyer stood up to put
Jesus to the test saying teacher what
shall I do to inherit eternal life he
said to him what is written in the law
how do you read it and he
answered you shall love the Lord your
God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your strength and
with all your mind and your neighbor as
yourself and Jesus said to him
you have answered correctly do this and
you will
live but he Desiring to justify himself
said to
Jesus and who is my neighbor Jesus
replied A man was going down from
Jerusalem to
[Music]
Jericho
and he fell among
robbers who stripped him and beat him
and departed leaving him half
dead now by chance a priest was going
down that road and when he saw him he
passed by on the other
side so likewise a levite when he came
to the place and saw him passed by on
the other
[Music]
side but a Samaritan as he journeyed
came to where he was and when he saw him
he had
compassion he went to him and bound up
his wounds pouring on oil and
[Music]
wine then he set him on his own animal
and brought him to an
end
[Music]
and took care of
him and the next day he took out two
dinari and gave them to the inkeeper
saying take care of him and whatever
more you spend I will repay you when I
come
back Jesus looked at the lawyer and
asked him
which of these three do you think proved
to be a neighbor to the man who fell
among the
[Music]
robbers he said the one who showed him
mercy and Jesus said to him you go and
do
[Music]
likewise
[Music]
the Lord is my
shepherd I shall not
want he maketh me to lie down in Green
Pastures he leadth
me beside Still Waters he restoreth my
soul he leadth me in the paths of
