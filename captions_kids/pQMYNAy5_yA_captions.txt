ippy w hey it's me Flippy and do you see
what I have yeah I have some crafts I
sure do love crafts check it out I have
a pair of
scissors I have a
stapler and then I have some
construction
paper yeah oo and look over
here yeah a Christmas tree oh it's that
time of year yeah it's the holiday
season hey and you and I in this video
yeah we're going to make a Christmas
tree chain decoration I'm really excited
all right this is going to be so much
fun so first what you need to do is make
sure sure there's a grownup around you
if you're going to use scissors yeah and
they will teach you how to use them
properly yeah so I'm first going to make
a pink stripe actually I'm going to make
a few of
[Music]
them that's enough pink all right how
about some orange
[Music]
okay we'll start with just two colors
and then we'll add some more colors
later but first you need to wrap this
around from end to end yeah just like
that then take your
stapler and staple it down oh
hello wow it's an orange
circle all right now what we're going to
do is take a pink stripe put it through
the orange stripe there we go yeah
perfect we did it look at that yeah okay
now we're going to wrap that around the
orange stripe okay and then we're going
to staple that one
[Music]
together whoa do you see what we're
doing yeah now they don't even come
apart okay let's put the orange one
through yeah see and then Loop it around
and
then staple it
who
whoa so cool all right I think we're
ready for some more colors okay let's
take some
red how about blue and
[Music]
yellow wo
W look at what we
made wow I think this is a pretty good
size so now what you want to do with
your chain is go to your Christmas tree
yeah and then you wrap it around the
tree how about right let's start right
here there we go that looks like a great
place to start and then I'm going to
wrap it back this way I'm not even going
to go around the whole tree
okay how about how about like that how
does that
look yeah that is awesome we have done
such a great job decorating this
Christmas tree together but we have
another craft to make yeah and this
craft is a snowflake ornament yeah have
you ever seen a snowflake before yeah
it's basically just frozen rain falling
down from the sky wo how about just a
plain white one yeah that's like the
color of real
snowflakes and this one let's make
another big one here we go Let's Fold It
Fold It fold it here we go okay so now
let's do a little bunch of cuts
[Music]
wow all right how does this look do you
think this is going to turn out really
cool yeah hey I have an idea why don't
we take a whole puncher and punch in a
hole at this stage that's cool okay oh
it's a little
tough actually we might need to unfold
it one time wa speaking of unfolding it
it looks so cool all right how about
let's make a hole punch right there
whoa let's make a hole punch right
here yeah another one right
here and another one right
here okay now let's unfold it
wo
wo
wo this one is awesome wo oh all right
we definitely have a lot of holes
already punched in it so I think we
should just hang it up and put it on the
tree who okay here we go how about right
uh right over
here uh right there yeah that looks
great how does that snowflake look yeah
good
job wow wow we have done such a great
job decorating this tree but we're not
done yet yeah we need to continue the
decorations with another at home
ornament and this is a snowflake
ornament so what we have here as you
know we have some colorful paint a hot
glue gun some
paperclips some paint brushes for the
paint some felt balls wow they're so
colorful look at
them and we have some craft sticks yeah
you've probably seen these before
haven't you yeah they're like popsicle
sticks yeah two popsicle sticks wo and
it actually says there's a thousand
sticks wao that is a lot of popsicle
sticks okay well I think we should
probably count them so then we can make
sure that we got all a thousand of them
ready 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
997
998 999
oh
no
999 where's the
Thousand
oh
no
hey yeah you're right right up here you
got it
1,000 popsicle
sticks okay well we should probably get
going on our craft now huh now that we
have all these popsicle sticks and all
of our crafts okay so first let's take
one
two three and four popsicle
sticks and let's super glue actually hot
glue them together so let's put just a
little bit right in the center and this
is very hot so
I would assume a grown-up will help you
with this okay going to put another one
right there and then put it just like
that okay another one right
there and we're going to
go just like that yeah how does that
look wo whoo looks really good huh yeah
looks like a snowflake okay we're not
done yet we need to decorate the
snowflake so I'm going to take the hot
glue gun and put some right on the edges
and put some of these colorful
[Music]
balls wow how does this look yeah okay
we'll let that sit right over there
while we make another one and this one
we'll use
[Music]
paint look at that hey I think we have
room for one
more now that looks like a great
snowflake okay now this one let's use
some paint
orange
blue red
[Music]
yellow
green
wow looks really good do you like
it yeah I like it too wow turned out
really good let's look at all the colors
we have green yellow blue
orange
red that's that's
all okay well last step we need to hot
glue another hanger on the top yeah
there we go and you could actually you
know hot glue some of these soft balls
on it too but we're not going to we're
just going to hot glue right on the
orange cuz that was the first color we
did so it's actually nice and dry there
we go
perfect awesome that looks really really
really
good okay we'll let this one dry but I
think in the meantime we should take
this one the one we did earlier and put
it on the
tree wow okay how about how about right
near the the top huh yeah let's take the
hook hook it right
there wow how does that snowflake
look wow I love love it good job okay I
think we should go get the other one
woo
okay yep I think it's dry okay
perfect all right how about right down
here
yeah
wow look at all of these holiday crafts
we made together wao did you have fun
yeah yeah I sure did too I really
enjoyed making all of these with you
well I'm excited to see what ones you
make this year yeah are you going to
make the chain yeah what a great tree

probably hang it from a
wall wo what about the construction
paper snowflakes wow they look so cool

yeah ooh the popsicle sticks
yeah the snowflakes made from popsicle
sticks wow those are also so cool and
colorful maybe you'll make just one

[Music]
yeah who this snowmobile is so
powerful do you know how the snowmobile
gets all of its
power yeah the
[Music]
engine
waa check that out looks like we have oh
this looks like maybe the engine oil W
that's what helps cool the engine um
let's see ooh looks like the fly wheel
some gears
oh and look at
this this is a front shock yeah this is
part of the suspension of the
snowmobile wo and look down
here this snowmobile has two skis one
right here and one over there wo that is
what's on the front to help steer the
snowmobile come on to the other
[Music]
side
wo the other engine
compartment W looks like we have the
exhaust in there you definitely don't
want to touch that that is really hot oh
and we have the intake
and we have the engine way down in there
wo this engine is so compact with so
much power all in the front of the
snowmobile come to the back check this
[Music]
out wow this is the track of the
snowmobile you see these big things
poking
up wow that helped it grip into the snow
so it doesn't slip and slide yeah that's
kind of like the tread on a wheel and
tire but this snowmobile does not have a
wheel or a
tire oh come check this
out all right this is the dash of the
snowmobile right here this is where it
tells you how fast you're going your
engine temperature oh and look it right
here yeah the key
yeah you know what that does when you
have that in then you turn it and that
is how you start the snowmobile but it's
not like a car where you just start it
with a key you have to
pull this check this
out yeah here come
here so for safety we have the brake and
not for safety we have the throttle here
we
[Music]
go

now and swim in that water that water
looks so
cold woohoo

blippy good to meet you m nice to Mee
you so what do you do well blippy I'm a
Storyteller I literally travel all over
the world sharing music and stories in
schools wow that's cool what do you tell
stories about
well most of the stories I tell teach
lessons on life and help children to
become the incredible adults that they
are destined to become o nice wow cool
but we're learning all about holidays oh
this is wonderful because I didn't know
who was coming but I prepared to teach
about a very special holiday to me oh
what is it the holiday of Quanza wow
Quanza that sounds cool before we go
inside can I just tell you a little bit
about about the instrument oh yeah
please this instrument is an ancient
harp out of West Africa that is played
by the oral historians or storytellers
and they've been playing it for hundreds
of years and they say that the history
of the people of West Africa can be
heard if you listen to the Kora really
so it's called a Kora it's called a Kora
spelled k o r a wow can we hear a little
bit more oh absolutely
[Music]
wow it's so peaceful I love it I love it
just as much I also love what you're
wearing purple's one of my favorite
colors is it really mine also M it's
mine in fact the history of this is very
important oh really now in West Africa
the language that I've learned to speak
now there's over 800 languages I do not
speak 800 langu but I do speak the
language of bam and in bam this is
called a BBA boa oh you guys did that so
good it's called a BBA and boas are well
like here when a person goes to
something formal to wear formal attire
they might wear a tuxedo yeah well in
West Africa well many parts of Africa
the buba is formal attire like a
tuxedo veryy
you do look very good thank you we are
so excited to learn about guaza with you
I tell you what since you guys are so
excited let's go inside and we can start
learning together about the
African-American holiday of Quanza oh
yeah let's
go can't wait Quanza is a holiday
honoring African-American culture wow
Baba there's so many cool things here
yeah I see
fruit and some corn oh I'm glad you guys
are so excited about this this is one of
my family's favorite holidays really
what is all this stuff well I'll tell
you what because you're learning allow
me to do it the way that I did with my
children when they were growing up okay
would that be okay yeah okay so one of
the things that we did is we sort of
made it a game now during K Quanza K
Quanza is 7 days and we use the language
of kiswahili out of East Africa so
everything here is a symbol and
everything has a ky Swahili name so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to say the
name of each of the symbols of quanda
and then you repeat the African word or
ke sping word that you hear all right
will you repeat the new words with us
yeah so let's start with the fruit okay
okay now I'm going to use this to point
out everything that is on the table and
then what I'll do is say it in keepah
what is that it looks like a ponytail do
you know every every school I ever visit
and my kindergarteners always say this
is a pony
pit but no this is actually called a sh
in bom it's it comes from the tals of
different animals so back a long time
ago people farmed and they had their
favorite animals and when those animals
would pass well then she was a way of
remembering those animals
a so let me use this to point out the
different symbols and don't forget say
the key healing name after me all right
so the fruit is called
mazow mazow good the corn is called
muindi mu now a lot of people don't
realize this but the map that everything
is on top of is
[Music]
calleda yes and now this is very
important that which is holding the
candles is called a canara
Nar yes and then we have seven candles
to represent the seven days of Quanza oh
cool seven yeah we know how to count to
seven mhm oh well let's play a little
game okay what I'm going to do is I have
a special way of counting the candle so
I'm going to say the name of each candle
in kis and then we will count each day
and I'll show you the special way of
counting all right's count them first
day of Quan We light the black CLE so
one umoja
two kuji
chulia
three
uima
four five
Nia
six seven imman wow and those are the
seven days of Quant ending on January
the 1st wow and what do they all mean
well in English blippy we start with the
Black Candle and it's Unity
self-determination Collective work and
responsibility Cooperative economics
purpose creativity and the final One
Faith wow that's so cool how every
candle has a meaning yes and every night
every evening when We Gather we
celebrate each of those principles in
fact you know what after we light the
canara we like to have a little fun are
you guys interested in enjoying some
things that we do in Quantum yeah
follow me over here and I'll introduce
you to a few activities we have during
Quant this is
awesome wow check it out ma snacks yeah
we love snacks yeah oh what are these
are these seeds well actually blippy
these are cocoa beans oh cocoa
beans and look at all of this Delicious
Fruit yeah and something important about
the fruit that during quanta it is
important to eat the fruit it is not
there for decoration it is there to be
consumed wow cool look bananas yeah and
an orange ooh and an apple yummy yum oh
look a book wow wait is that you that's
me yes this this is a book that I wrote
about my very first trip to Africa when
I learned The Art of Storytelling and I
learned to become a Storyteller playing
the Kora that's
amazing what do books have to do with
Quanza well books are a very important
part of K Quanza blippy because you see
with every gift that a child receives
there should be a book attached to it
wow cool I love bu yeah oh there's
another part of quan that something that
my children love to do we love to play
games together we like it do you see
this game here this is a game this is a
game wow cool how do you playing why let
me explain a little bit about the game
first because a lot of people are
familiar with this game already here in
this country I think they call it
Malala I play that before but in Ghana
where this game came from they call it
wari so wari let me explain how it's
played okay each of you would pick a
side to be on so M what side would you
like to be on um I think this side okay
so blippy you'll be on this side okay
one of the first things you're going to
do ma is you're going to pick up four
seeds from your side and then move
forward dropping them into each one of
these little pots any one that I want
any one you want on your side I'm going
to choose this one W and count one 2 3
four now Lippy on your side you do the
same thing you can pick any of them okay
I'll do this one okay all right 1 2 3
four and the one you put in there five
that is wonderful so all the objective
of the game now is you Lippy have to
capture on Ma's side and Ma you have to
capture on bli blippy side so when you
get on that side over there blippy you
make four anytime you make four you pick
them up and the first one to make and
pick up and empty the other side wins W
that sounds like fun it's a lot of fun
actually it's a lot of fun my children
loved it when they were growing up oh
cool and what do you do with the fruit
you said you eat it the fruit is
important not only do we eat it but it's
also symbolic of something Lippy Ma look
the fruit grows after well you know how
Farmers work they work really hard yeah
so they put the seeds in the ground and
when the seeds grow they produce the
fruit so we eat the fruit because we
have worked so hard to make it wow yeah
and in fact
this is celebrated in many parts of the
world
wow well we do love fruit it is very
healthy and tasty yeah we love it cool
you do so many things to celebrate
Quanza oh there is so much to quanta you
can be as creative as you need to be
with quanta wait
creative that's one of the candles on
the canara you
remembered Kumba Kumba oh you guys are
so good at this you are wonderful in
fact let me show you how I have been
creative with my family during Quan with
music and stories do you like music and

favorite parts of Quant in the evening
for my children the storytelling portion

you on this a little bit so here's what
we're going to do I'm going to teach you

sounds to you give it back okay okay are
you guys ready yeah okay let's do this
[Music]
[Music]
now there was once a little girl she was
maybe four five years no older than 5
years old and she was standing outside
in her backyard and in each of her hands
she had an Apple so she had two apples
one in each hand
[Music]
so her mother saw her through the back
window of the house and her mother
decided that well she wanted to see if
her daughter had learned to be kind to
share so the mother she went out to the
little girl and she looked at her and
she said I see you have two apples one
in each hand and the little girl looks
at the apples and she says looking up at
her mommy she says mhm MH
[Music]
now the mother says oh the apples look
so delicious and the little girl she
says mhm and then here comes the test
the Mommy's going to test her the mommy
says to the little girl she says may I
have one of your
apples mhm and right after the mommy
asks the little girl takes the Apple in
her right hand and she bites into it and
starts chewing and then she takes the
Apple in her left hand and she bites
into it and she's chewing and her mommy
cannot not believe that she's doing this
her mother looks at her and her mother
is thinking I taught my daughter to
share I taught my daughter to be nice I
can't believe my daughter is doing this
the mommy is so
disappointed and then right when the
mommy opens her mouth to well tell her
daughter how disappointed she is the
little girl holds up the Apple in her
right hand and she says here mommy this
one is for you it's the sweetest

big white one in the middle oh yeah and
this one doesn't have a number yeah hm
there's nine total candles that's a lot
yeah but eight of them have numbers yeah
interesting yeah hey blippy yeah there
are more candles over there whoa wow hey
hi who are you my name is idon oh nice
to meet you I'm Lippy and I'm M hi hello
nice to meet you guys too we're getting
ready to celebrate Hanukkah do you guys
want to learn something about Hanukkah
yes we are so curious about that holiday
yeah my goodness why do you use candles
well during Hanukah we're celebrating
the miracle of a bottle of oil that was
supposed to last for only one day and it
actually lasted for eight whole days wow
that's a lot longer than one day yeah
that's a long time so here we have our
candles and you can see that there's
actually nine candles yeah the the
candle in the middle is called the
shamash or it's our helper candle and we
use it to light all the other candles so
each candle represents each night eight
night exactly exactly would you guys
like me to show you how we light a
manora yeah yeah
oh all right is the helper candle yeah
oh that makes sense so you use the
helper candle to light all the other
candles
wow wow it looks so pretty yeah oh so
what are some other cool things that you
do with Hanukkah well after you like the
candles your family can sit together
sing songs give each other gifts and
play Dre
doll and I have something just for you
really what do you mean like a gift well
like I said we like to give gifts to our
families each night of Hanukkah so here
I have a special gift for you your very
own manora wow a manora so
special and this is where the candles go
yeah thank you of course and after you
light your candles don't forget that you
put your manora in the window sill so
you can share the light of Hanukkah with
everybody that's so nice yeah wow wow
and you said drle yeah what's that so
Dro is a really fun game would you guys
like to learn a little bit more about it
yeah we love games yeah amazing well
let's head over there and I can teach
you some all right can we set these
right here totally okay all right here
you go check it out wow cool did you
guys see these up here before yeah yeah
these yeah yeah these are the shape of a
drele because a drele has four sides oh
and on each side of a drele is a
different letter from the Hebrew
alphabet Oh that's what these are oh
these are letters wow so each one of
these helps say a sentence n ha sham A
great miracle happened there which is
about the miracle of Hanukkah wow wow
and then these look really similar it is
almost the same but it has a different
letter at the end that letter stands for
the word ho or here cuz that's the dral
they use in Israel where the miracle
happened wow cool would you guys like to
play drle on your own yeah wow we've got
lots of dros here so why don't you go
check it out see you
[Music]
soon wa W so cool yeah look it's the
drel that she was talking about oh yeah
and they're so colorful yeah oh check it
out I have an orange one a blue one a
green one wow and there's purple woo and
yellow too I love those colors yeah and
look the Hebrew letters wow yeah we just
learned about those oh and look at these
yeah the Jewish star check it out wow so
cool what's in there oh wow gold coins W
I wonder what that's for yeah we're rich
yeah wow hey guys I see you found all of
the drel so many and we found a bunch of
gold too yeah oh well those are actually
called GS and I hate to break it to you
but they're made of
chocolate even butter chocolate wow what
do you do with these well do you guys
want to play the game yeah yeah all
right well you got to put some of our g
into the pot okay how about four sounds
good good and then each person needs to
have a couple of pieces of GT to start
as well okay you can have two you can
have two than you and I will have two
nice all right all right so then
somebody's going to take a turn and go
first and spin the drle so who wants to
go first ma okay I'll do this one okay
here we
go waa wow so that is the letter hey
that means you get half of the gelp
that's in the pot okay so half so
there's four coins so half would be two
yeah wow you're so lucky now you have
four yeah wow okay you're up next oh my

hill so then you don't have to walk all
the way up there I'll show you that soon
but
first this is an Ender tube wa this
Ender tube has a red cover on it wo it
protects the inner tube the actual inner
tube is black and rubber on the inside
see and
then there's an inner tube leash and
this ring is what the hook hooks on to
that then it toes
you up to the top of the hill
wo
W let's go check it out
[Music]
okay check it out so this machine yeah
there's cables there there's gears check
out the
gears W do you see those gears spinning
around and that is what is providing all
its strength and power for these
hooks right there to tow the tube and
the person to the top of the hill all
right let's hook one up and then we'll
watch the entner tube

is this is a black rubber at it's really
heavy and this is a gray carpet yeah
just like maybe carpet that you might
