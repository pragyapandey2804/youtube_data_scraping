mommy cleans the dirty floor She sweeps
it like the day before then she does the
house real nice she does it once then
does it twice she's the best cleaner no
doubt but it's time for us to help her

she could stop and play she has lots of
work to do taking care of me and you no
time to stop and rest our mommy's the
very best mommy makes so close so clean
put in them in the washing machine then
she hangs them up to dry underneath the
sunny Sky there's so much she has to do

tired every day I wish that she could
stop and play she has lots of work to do
taking care of me and you no time to
