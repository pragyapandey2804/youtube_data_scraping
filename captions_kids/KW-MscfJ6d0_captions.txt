I remember when your dad got
sick was in a mountain that you wouldn't
move you gave everything you had to
give cuz you knew you had everything to
lose one day I'll take care of you like
you took care of him
drive you to the mall St your bar with
Jin love you through the L just like you
always did one day before we know it
parents become the
kids I remember when I couldn't
sleep you were always there by my side
and if someone ever broke my
[Music]
heart you would dry all of the tears
that I
CED and one day I'll take care of you
like you took care of me I'll drive you
to the mall I'll buy your
groceries I love you through the lows
just like you always did
one day before we know it parents become
the
kids then it might never
happen but if I ever have
them I hope that somay they'll take take
care of me like I'll take care of them

the lows just like you always did one
day before we know it there ain't much
