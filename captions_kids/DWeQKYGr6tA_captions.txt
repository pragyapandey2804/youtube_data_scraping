yeah okay
[Music]
[Applause]
go
y sink yeah why do some stuff float and
why does some stuff sink the answerd is
something that is called density
everything is made out of tiny particles
that we can't see a plastic spoon and a
metal spoon have the same shape and size
but the part particles in the metal
spoon are closer to each other water has
density also the density of metal is
more than the density of water so it
sinks the density of plastic is less
than the density of water so the plastic
spoon
floats do you like this experiment yeah
sink or flood sink flol
