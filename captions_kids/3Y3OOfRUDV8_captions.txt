W Hunley always LED people through the
lobby so he used his skills to lead
George around
[Music]
obstacles there was more to monkey
sitting George than guiding him around
the
furniture Hunley cleaned up after him
too which had its
[Music]
rewards he also helped with those itches
that George couldn't reach
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
every day George's chair driving
improved and Hunley looked forward to
coming
[Music]
over good morning to you too
Hunley and then something changed
[Music]
remember use the crutches don't step on
your cast and be a good little monkey
and
doxent they taught George to use the
crutches in the
[Music]
hospital but he needed
[Music]
practice pretty soon George was as good
on crutches as he was on his own
[Music]
feet and as soon as he got really
good good news Hundley George is allowed
to walk on his cast
[Music]
now George showed Hunley how his leg was
healing but Doxon don't read x-rays
[Music]
Hunley didn't like to get too far from
his
[Music]
lobby but George wanted to go for a
walk he also wanted to go for a
[Music]
climb but that wasn't allowed Hunley was
one serious monkey
sitter they went to the park every day
George drew some good pictures
[Music]
and Hunley discovered he liked lying on
grass and taking slow strolls with a
[Music]
monkey see the brakes all
[Music]
healed woo
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
well
[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
hello George was thrilled to be
completely free
again back to normal I see good as new
thanks for all of your help
[Music]
Hundley guess you're back on Lobby Duty
with me
Boy George wanted Hunley to come with
him but Hunley had a job to
[Music]
do un
[Music]
[Music]
George brought his friends back so he
and Hunley could be
[Music]
together George was back to normal all
[Music]
right now I'll be home later remember no
bothering the new neighbor who is not an
elephant
[Music]
H the new neighbor wasn't an elephant he
had an elephant George felt very
[Music]
misunderstood why the elephant must have
gone out
[Music]
too well that thing would never fit
inside the apartment
[Music]
H could there be a chainsaw in
[Music]
Mabel's so many things made similar
sounds how could George figure out what
he'd been hearing
upstairs for George to be certain he had
to go right to the source
[Music]
that sort of sounded like his
neighbor but not
really the Man with the Yellow Hat was
right George hadn't H an
elephant but then what had he
heard that was the
[Music]
sound wo
[Laughter]
so the upstairs neighbor has a Galapagos
tortoise that's been wrapping gifts and
making
[Music]
juice George I'm going to say this one
more time there is no way
[Music]
yes hi there we're your downstairs
neighbors and oh so nice to meet
[Music]
you George
[Music]
what's he doing I think he's looking for
your a elephant my
what oh we heard some loud sounds um
very loud
sounds very l oh I am so sorry sometimes
I get carried away working on my
art
art I am an artist I do murals I mix my
paint
[Music]
here then I used these rubber stamps I
made
[Music]
here's one of my completed
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
workso oh uh we also heard something
like a bag of rocks dropping do you use
rocks in your
work no uh
oh that was a bag of groceries it fell
off the
[Music]
counter
[Music]
H what on Earth is that
sounds like an elephant finger
painting it
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
does George never realized Iz that
Hunley spent so much of the day playing
this was
[Music]
fun only his hands weren't used to being
dog
paws George realized he needed a few
small changes to be a good
[Music]
dog did you have a nice ride
Dante a I bet you
[Music]
did well what is
this well Hundley it looks like we have
two Lobby dogs today what do you think
of that

[Music]
[Applause]
doggies but being Hunley wasn't all fun
in
[Music]
games ow it helped to be long and low to
do this
job oh thank you look Dante Hundley
found your ball good
dog George wanted to be a good dog too
just like his new hero Hunley hold the
elevator and here was his
chance but picking up things with your
mouth was harder than it looked that's a
baby right hi
[Music]
baby thank you um that's a dog right
thanks
doggy Hunley couldn't believe it
everyone knew dogss were more dignified
than
that being a dog was hard work just look
what it did to
Hunley
delivery looks important we'll get it
upstairs right
away come on Lobby dogs
[Music]
uh-oh hey looks like we're
stuck
oh it's okay Hundley we can handle this
I'll Sound the
Alarm
uh-oh oh there's only one way out but we
need somebody who can monkey
up S
[Music]
you've been such a good dog George I
almost forgot you were a
monkey George had almost forgotten he
was a monkey
too there were things monkeys could
easily do that no one else
[Music]
could hello I'd like to report a stuck
elevator
best of all George didn't even have to
think about how to be a
monkey it just came
naturally a flashlight thanks
George and a bottle of
water and cushions and a
radio and sometimes a
[Music]
monkey was just the thing to
[Music]
be George you did it thanks
George even Hunley thought George was
pretty
amazing he might even make a good dog
someday
but George didn't want to be a dog
anymore all he wanted was to take a
bath brush his
teeth and go to bed in his nice clean
[Music]
room luckily someone left these skates
in the recycling
[Music]
center see what we'll do is I'll have
skates on then I'll lift the corner of
the wagon then you pull it and
me H sometimes George I think I'm a
genius gee skating's harder than it
looks hey I know we'll take one of these
skates strap her to the block of wood
right then
or maybe we'll just use your baby
carriage wheel
[Music]
George you need to put
[Music]
the yeah that's what I was going to
[Music]
say well here goes
nothing hey it works
[Music]
kind of wants to turn all the
[Music]
time huh I guess we need a wheel exactly
the same size as the other ones huh
[Music]
nope
nope
nope you know what I'm starting to think
hurling Betsy's wheel down the hill
wasn't such a great idea after
all we'll never find another wheel the
exact same size as the other three
unless we shrink them all of this
[Music]
size I guess I'll go call Aunt
[Music]
Margaret
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
what you tried one of those remember see
there's three
left George that's
it there now they're all the same
[Music]
size George you saved the day hi you
guys
o hey George did you help Steve go get
my wagon
look I can explain everything see I have
this crazy idea I thought if wait we
didn't go get your wagon we brought the
wagon with us to get your
package but that's what's in the package
[Music]
see Aunt Margaret got me a new wagon
since the wheels on my old one kept
popping off
a what's the
[Music]
matter looks great George I'm so
grateful to you for helping Steve I want
you to have my old
one huh too bad we never found the
fourth wheel those baby carriage Wheels
won't hold up long ice cream
anybody sure H I wonder what happened to
that other wheel
oh well some things are just a
[Music]
mystery hold it closer to the heavy end
[Music]
George do you want to do something just
like we do that you don't have to
practice
[Music]
for hand out these flyers to everyone

zucchini he gave out every
flyer and that
night everyone he knew came to the
show

problem Leo just to back

oh and you're welcome to practice with
us anytime so that was all real oh I'm
glad I didn't know I I would have
worried ah nothing to worry about George
is a natural
[Music]

Highwire George was really flying that
kite

monkey's best dream come
true now that he' lived his
dream his arm was getting sore and he
wanted to go home but he had no idea how
to do that George oh I could have swore

how to do everything what are you going
to do I'm going up there after
him the world below looked beautiful and
unfamiliar George wasn't even sure which
way was home anymore

hungry flying was the best and the worst
thing that had happened to him all
day George
George it was his friend The Man with
the Yellow hang
glider George I need you to reach out
and take my hand with a hand uh foot
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
whatever all right guys hang on tight

forget the day he was almost a
bird and he added almost being a bird to
the list of things squirrels don't
like you're a natural kite Fier

lunch for you too jumpy
it's time to bring her in
[Music]
George
[Music]

[Music]
yet George's tree had everything a tree
has
including a homing pigeon in his new
home
[Music]
oh look at this look at
this wow that's a lot of dirt I left
Hundley in charge and when I came back
dirt
everywhere if only I spoke Doon I wish
you spoke
pigeon a homing pigeon's been living on
our balcony for
little blue pigeon with a yellow tag
yeah you've seen it
too that's
Compass I thought he was lost forever
and I thought the pigeon would be
happier on the balcony if it had a small
tree to oh no oh bowling what if one of
us spoke doent I bet this wouldn't have
been a surprise George where are you
[Music]
[Music]
is that a
tree George had never felt prouder now
that he had the perfect home the bird
could live here
[Music]
forever Compass good to see
you yeah Compass is an almost home ing
pigeon he wanted mid is's a weak sense
of
direction George the doorman is the
pigeon's friend he came to take him
home to his real
[Music]
home everybody look who's
home see he's back where he
belongs oh
[Music]
I bought it for birds to sit in so you
can draw
them nice effort George but birds want
to sit in a real
[Music]
tree compass look a real tree for you
make yourself at home
[Music]
the pigeons still didn't know what
George was but he sure made a good
tree so George headed home with one
dozen donuts and everything was
perfect wait I don't have your
address he must be
late oh you took too long to make the
donuts
there we're sorry
[Music]
you're in charge while I'm gone
Hundley George realized he couldn't go
home because then those donut people
would know where he
lived wo we're right behind you
[Music]
so in the end George headed home with
one dozen donuts there's no monkey on
that
[Music]
dog
monkey we lost him
[Music]
[Laughter]
Door

propeller and a good solid
bottom okay a wide
boat with steam coming

out of regular ribbons I'll take care of
this I'll ask him to make you one that

Clock would show him exactly what to do
with the little clock
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]

[Music]
stopped but maybe it was time to pack up

[Music]
so that puffy making oven was even more
amazing than the floify
PO oh oh my goodness if salesio likes my
food she's tell everybody to eat here
wish me
[Music]
luck George wanted to show Noki how pots
make things floppy
[Music]
what was all of that
noise I give what what have you done but
I can't serve delicate pasta with a
little monkey sitting in
it at least I still have this batch of
PL
spaghetti George knew the chef would be
happy with all the fun extra things he'd
turned
floppy who turned my plane pasta into
crowded spoon soup
[Music]
somehow floify didn't work on
spoons there isn't one cherry tomato in
this salad you promise cherry
[Music]
tomatoes well I oh don't wait no please
I I don't like this at all but it smells
good she was right the longer that stuff
stay stayed in the floify pot the better
it
smelled do you know there's a cat and a
monkey in your kitchen
oh the
monkey made this
sto oo quite good oh but you said you
like it if you made it it's no good but
for a monkey woohoo what's his recipe
well uh never mind mind I got
it Chef biscetti didn't scold George
much but he insisted George clean up the
mess he
made oh you're lucky you got the four
hands you can do things twice as
quickly I wish I knew how you chose
these
ingredients asparagus the green Spears
turned out nice and floppy one
hardboiled egg
[Music]
but the egg didn't look floppy at all
eggs don't
floify they get
harder a lot of
cheese and cheese becomes
goop cooking seem to have no rules at
all I'm done you said they'd be cookies
please this dish was excellent what do
you call it sudden emergency ravioli and
and the meatball four stars and another
star for the meatball I'll give your
monkey a star too oh I'm so generous hot
cook is coming up as
[Music]
promised how did he make that into
[Music]
that maybe kitchens aren't magic maybe
it's Cooks who are magic YY how you can
lose so many bows
[Music]
huh any day that starts out just
smelling and ends with a
cookie is a pretty great
[Music]
day being a dog Hunley had tasted a lot
of tennis balls
but these were the first that ever
tasted like
ink these were the valuable balls the
doorman promised to
[Music]
protect Hunley couldn't stop George from
opening boxes that he thought belonged
to him w but he knew how to play
[Music]
defense it was tough for George to guess
who sent all this stuff to him
[Music]
uh hold on there's a monkey and a weener
dog at the
door those careless delivery guys if any
of my balls aren't properly packed I'm
going to be very upset now George
understood these boxes belonged here and
the delivery man gave them to George by
mistake I'll be down to check every last
one as soon as I'm off the
pH they had to clean up before the ball
collector came
[Music]
downstairs all they had to do was put
the balls back into the right
boxes how hard could that be
[Music]
sometimes things don't fit when they
look like they
should or they fit in more than one
[Music]
place but there's only one place they
really belong and once you figure that
out it's easy
even if you're a monkey
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
Hunley showed George how to lay them
[Music]
flat haa
they did
it all the balls were back where they
started kind of
[Music]
[Music]
looks like they're all here oh even the
Priceless Andy turkey rolly perfect
score bowling
ball I'm
[Music]
back is everything okay my delivery
came your dog and monkey took care of
everything that's great thank you
Hundley thank you George it's nice to
know Hundley has help keeping the place
